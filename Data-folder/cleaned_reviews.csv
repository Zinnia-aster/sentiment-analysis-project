Never seen the anime and still enjoyed it,I have to admit that I've never watched any of the animated show One Piece or even heard about it for that matter. I'm really not a big fan of anime. Then after watching the trailers for this I thought it looked like a show for children. I was wrong. I kept reading about how good this show is and how it's #1 on Netflix so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did because I couldn't have been more wrong. This is a show where people of all ages can enjoy. If you can just turn off your brain and watch I promise you'll have a good time. If you're looking for a new show to binge then give One Piece a try. You won't be disappointed!,04-Sep-23,8.0,admit ive never watched animated show one piece even heard matter im really big fan anime watching trailers thought looked like show children wrong kept reading good show netflix thought id give chance im glad couldnt wrong show people ages enjoy turn brain watch promise youll good time youre looking new show binge give one piece try wont disappointed
Not My Kind of Show. But This I Loved.,"I'm a 60yo man & old school like the The Marine Admiral üòÑ. I've never heard of One Piece anime, in fact I'm not into anime at all. But this, this was a complete experience, it is bloody addictive.

The main characters optimism & acceptance of others pursuing their dreams regardless of whether or not he agrees with them or indeed they're the dreams of his enemies is a thing of beauty. The kids attitude to his fellow man is admirable & his attitude toward pursuing his own life should serve as a lesson to us all.

The other characters come together nicely too, each different but each with unique problems & gifts - they gel nicely.

I can't put my finger on why I loved this show, I just did. It's quirky, it's violent, it's gentle, it's about battles, friendships, dreams, courage, fear & loyalty, & all of it done meaningfully.

It's also beautiful to look at.

I hope there is a season 2. It deserves to continue.

I'm Shocked By How Good This Is...,"Every live action anime that I've briefly seen has been nothing short of a disaster, and considering how many times Netflix tried to bring Anime's to life I thought One Piece was about to receive the same fate. But to my surprise I was wrong.

Just 3 episodes in you could tell the care the creators put into this show. The set designs, the action sequences, and even to my surprise the actors bring so much.

I√±aki Godoy as Luffy is to my surprise holding his own in this role. Luffy is such a love or hate character and imagining a live action for him seems like a recipe for disaster. But Godoy somehow is able to maintain the goofiness within the character without making him unbearable, and that deserves some applause. I think Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Morgan Davies, and Jacob Romero are great as well.

And as someone who's only watched the first 10-15 episodes of One Piece, I love the route they went with Buggy in episode 2 compared to the beginning of the Anime/Manga. Jeff Ward made him extremely terrifying in the show and the way they used the crowd as prisoners, forcing them to clap was slightly terrifying.

I wasn't even sure if they'd do the iconic Shanks moment early on for budget reasons, but they did it and it was actually great. Not to say everything is perfect because at times the show can get a little too cartoony for me, but my low expectations were blown away. I'm glad to see the awful live action anime stereotype take a hit and potentially make room for other people who aspire to bring an anime to life, and even with a very small chance, potentially do it justice like we saw here.

It's only season 1 and there is plenty of room for error, but I'm glad to say I've been proven wrong and I actually have hope for this adaptation.",01-Sep-23,9.0,every live action anime ive briefly seen nothing short disaster considering many times netflix tried bring animes life thought one piece receive fate surprise wrong episodes could tell care creators put show set designs action sequences even surprise actors bring much iaki godoy luffy surprise holding role luffy love hate character imagining live action seems like recipe disaster godoy somehow able maintain goofiness within character without making unbearable deserves applause think emily rudd mackenyu morgan davies jacob romero great well someone whos watched first episodes one piece love route went buggy episode compared beginning animemanga jeff ward made extremely terrifying show way used crowd prisoners forcing clap slightly terrifying wasnt even sure theyd iconic shanks moment early budget reasons actually great say everything perfect times show get little cartoony low expectations blown away im glad see awful live action anime stereotype take hit potentially make room people aspire bring anime life even small chance potentially justice like saw season plenty room error im glad say ive proven wrong actually hope adaptation
See Netflix?? You CAN do it...,"This is bar none one of the best live-action adaptions to any animated source material I have ever seen. I have been a diehard One Piece fan since I was a preteen; it was one of the first manga I ever read and I still watch it to this day. Admittedly, when I first saw a remake was in the works and saw the promos for it, I could feel myself almost instinctively getting nauseous. I saw the characters and bauked at the mere aesthetics of the show, let alone the other details. My heart sank into a pit as I pleaded pitifully in my head, ""Please, PLEASE don't touch this one. I still haven't recovered from the massacring of Avatar TLA, Dragonball Evolution (I know those weren't Netflix, but still), Death Note, AND FullMetal Alchemist, please don't destroy something else from my childhood just for the sake of playing pretend and trying to get subscriptions .""

But lo and behold, I watched the trailer for it and every previously described feeling of dread in me was evaporated by a sudden rush of euphoria and excitement. I had goosebumps on my goosebumps and my heart was in my throat. I immediately resubscribed to Netflix and began watching and MY-GOSH, guys.

I will restate that this is the best adaption of any source material I've ever seen. I will warn you the more ""human"" looking rendition of the characters takes some getting used to, but my gosh, it's all there - the humor, the action, the heart, and barely a single editorial or filmographic choice is wasted. You're not going to find a cut-by-cut (no pun intended, Zoro) rendition of the original story, but that actually works here and keeps things moving and working in a cohesive way.

For first time fans or devoted veterans like me, you could not ask for a better introduction to an anime series in this medium.

WE WANT SEASON 2,"Being a one piece fan myself, I was a bit insecured about starting the series but boy do I never got off my bed through all these 8 episodes. The Live Adaptation is way beyond my expectations and I seriously cried and laughed along every emotional and comforting moment. NETFLIX PLEASE RELEASE SEASON 2. The portrayal of Monkey D Luffy was perfect as well as other characters.

"Not an anime fan, but this a fun adventure!","My kids play and watch One Piece anime and love it! I wasn't terribly interested, but decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did! I enjoyed most of the Witcher (played the games as well), but in all honesty, this show is just more entertaining (yes, i realize a different genre but i was thrilled for the witcher series). The characters, especially Buggy (the clown), are well acted, fights scenes different and action-packed, and the cgi is rather good...that sea dragon should be in GoT or House of the Dragon!

Netflix can make something great,"I was so surprised that Netflix made something that was incredible. I am a new fan of One Piece anime and I had only seem as few of the episodes when I heard that Netflix was releasing a live action of One Piece.

As I watched the first few episodes I could see that they had stuck closely to the source material. I got more and more excited with each episode.

Everything is awesome! All the actors are incredible. Each one embodies his or her character as if it was written for them. I especially love I√±aki Godoy, the actor who plays Monkey D. Luffy self proclaimed ""King of the Pirates"". He is an amazing actor.

The story is about friendship and protecting your friends and their dreams even if you don't agree.

There has never been a pirate series or film that is better than One Piece. I will be rewatching it often.",11-Sep-23,10.0,surprised netflix made something incredible new fan one piece anime seem episodes heard netflix releasing live action one piece watched first episodes could see stuck closely source material got excited episode everything awesome actors incredible one embodies character written especially love iaki godoy actor plays monkey luffy self proclaimed king pirates amazing actor story friendship protecting friends dreams even dont agree never pirate series film better one piece rewatching often
Refreshingly Fun,"Parenthetically I don't know anything about the source material in particular or anime in general.

The series is compulsively watchable for several reasons.

The first is the world-building. The setting is fantastical but the show makes it effortlessly understandable and relatable.

The second is the characters. The characters here are mostly tropes but they're so likeable and well-realized by the performers that you can't help getting invested in them.

The third is the sense of light-hearted positivity that pervades the series. It touches on some pretty dark issues but the show and its irrepressibly-optimistic protagonist always have a positive outlook. People's faith in one another is actually rewarded rather than being mocked or denigrated.

Best show of the year!!,"Initially I was apprehensive because of anime adaptation productions for live action. I've been watching and reading onepiece for 20 years and this series so represents the spirit of this work that I love so much. I was very happy with the result!

And I have to say , Honestly, the best live action anime adaptation I've ever seen. This is coming from someone who loves One Piece. So, I was looking for reasons to criticise it, and there are some flaws.. but there were also things this series improved on the original. Overall, I you all should watch it , totally recommend it.

"I was hesitant to start, but then couldn't stop","So I binged this in one day. I had no idea it was a manga until after I had watched it, but still enjoyed the concept. I can see how it would have been based off a manga now.

It was silly and fun, but with adult style violence. I would recommend this over and over.

The acting was brilliant, the costumes were brilliant and the concept is brilliant. It's so nice to have a lighthearted show on Netflix. I have been getting over the amount of drama/FBI type shows.

I don't think I have any faults when it comes to this show.

Get comfy and be prepared to want to watch the next episode every time.

The live action curse breaker,"Despite the negative reviews from some people who judged the series before watching it, I decided to give it a chance and watch the first episode. I was really surprised by how well they adapted the story from the manga, even though they made some changes to the plot. The changes did not affect the overall narrative and actually added some depth and complexity to the characters and the setting. The production value was impressive, with realistic costumes, props, special effects and PRACTICAL SETS. It felt like I was watching a movie rather than a TV show.

The first episode left me wanting more and curious about how the series will progress. I hope they will keep up the quality and the faithfulness to the source material.",31-Aug-23,9.0,despite negative reviews people judged series watching decided give chance watch first episode really surprised well adapted story manga even though made changes plot changes affect overall narrative actually added depth complexity characters setting production value impressive realistic costumes props special effects practical sets felt like watching movie rather tv show first episode left wanting curious series progress hope keep quality faithfulness source material
Already looking forward to next season,"One Piece has definitely lived up to all the hype surrounding it. One Piece is based off the anime show of the same name. It's about a guy named Monkey D. Luffy and his pirate crew. They explore the fantasy world of oceans and exotic islands in the search for the worlds ultimate treasure and the right to be called the Pirate King. Yes, it sounds like a kiddy version of Pirates of the Caribbean but it's not. As you can see it's gotten great ratings from fans and critics alike with a 8.5 score here and a 83% on Rotten Tomatoes. This is definitely going to be one of Netflix's next big shows.

"Campy, silly, and so much fun","I've never watched the anime or read the manga before, and honestly, wasn't fully sold by the trailer, but after I started watching it, I was hooked. I did not expect to enjoy this show as much as I did. The actors were well cast and the story was fun and compelling. You really get to like the characters, both heroes and villains, and want to see what happens to them. There's also a lot of heart to the story that goes beyond cliches. It was probably tricky to adapt an anime series into a live action format, and I feel it struck the right balance, and succeeded where other adaptations didn't.

Now I'm going to have to start watching the anime series, and it's a good thing Netflix has them.

Netflix had better renew this for more seasons or I'm canceling my subscription.

Are you kidding me?,"I've never seen the anime so I had zero context about it. I've been on the side where you've seen/read the original source material and hated the live-action adaptation. So I did start this show with a bit of a bias towards the expectation that it's not going to be great. It took a few minutes in the beginning to get used to it but man I don't remember the last show/movie that had my eyes glued to the screen like this.

I mean I can understand if the anime fans find some issues in it because I've kinda been there (everyone loved TLOU TV show but I couldn't not compare it to the games. I noticed so many minute details about the behavior and expressions of some characters in the TV adaptation that made me think things like ""that's not what Joel would do""). So I can't fault the people who watched the Anime for not liking some bits. But being a neutral, I found this show exceptionally entertaining to the point that I just started ignoring the minor flaws (like it doesn't have the best CGI or it does have a couple of cheesy dialogs) . It has to be 10/10 for me because has everything:
Incredible characters and character development.



Surprisingly, it has depth and makes you think. It's far from just a shallow copy-paste of the source material.

A fever dream One Piece but still very One Piece in its core,"Warnings: Blood here and there, one nudity scene but nothing full frontal, self harm

For the nonfans of One Piece or anime: The source material is goofy and not truly based on any Earth history. The show leans into it so expect some hokey ridiculous looks. Costumes will have ranges of modern looks to 18th century etc. Some characters might even give you uncanny valley because of the absurdity. Think like The Mask, Scooby-Doo LA, Lazy Town, or Series of Unfortunate Events.

The fights aren't grounded but more akin to Wuxia or Wirefu. If you've watched shows like Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, RRR, or Shang Chi then that's similar to it. You get humans jumping really high. Running on walls in a 90 degree angle. Spinning mid air etc. Basically don't think of the rules of Earth physics.

Don't be fooled by what you just see however, the story and themes gets serious too. One Piece tackles themes like oppression, slavery, racism, family loss etc...It's one of the best world building story that's 25 years in the making. And the show takes advantage of that benefit of hindsight.

Overall it's an uplifting yet dramatic story in an inventive world that runs towards optimism. Luffy (Inaki Godoy) is a force of nature. He affects and inspires people around him. The Strawhat crew- I do not exaggerate when I say- is one of the best Found Family there is.

If you like absurdism fantasy action adventure do check this out!

For the fans and my general review: ""Stop counting only those things you have lost! What is gone, is gone. So ask yourself this. What is there that still remains to you?"" --Oda

One has to remember this show is not a recreation. It's an adaptation. There's also no such thing as 1-1 adaptation. Game of Thrones had changes. Harry Potter had changes. Lord of the Rings had changes. But these became loved because they succeeded in translating the heart of the story and essense of the characters. As a fellow fan for over 10 years...I believe One Piece Live Action did it too even with all the changes. The Manga and Anime will always be with us and now we just have additional content through the live action. I'd say it's about 70% faithful to how the manga progresses? Like if you remove what they added and just compare the core of the plotlines it'll be similar.

Anyway, I followed the live action news, got into the production perspective and I'm happy that these people are in love with One Piece even more than I am. Their decision not to ground too much in reality is so refreshing. I'm so tired of live action adaptations always looking so gray and gritty!! Realistic but not grounded by realism is what we need!! That's how you lose magic when you limit yourself in always keeping it ""real"". Embrace the absurd and goofy. Look at it with a child-like wonder filter. Get into that Romantic adventure. Take in the corny and cheesy stuff.

Overall this show is far from perfect. I'd say as an adaptation it's about 7.5/10 but I'm rating it a 9 because I enjoyed it for what it is and it greatly entertained me as a show. There's plenty I can nitpick from especially since they didn't include some scenes that I personally love but I can forgive the negatives over the many positives it has. This show is truly one made by fans and you can feel that from the costumes, the world, the characters...down to the easter eggs they sprinkled in. I truly enjoyed it as a whole.

People need to stop comparing...,"Evaluate the show on its own merits rather than drawing comparisons with the anime series. The show presents a unique interpretation of the idea, rendering direct comparisons illogical and potentially distorting the accuracy of other reviews.

Regarding the show itself, it undeniably offers an impressive viewing experience. It ranks among the most captivating series I've encountered recently. The action sequences are skillfully executed, and the integration of comedy is seamless, resulting in a flawless amalgamation.

It's perplexing why certain individuals have awarded the show a low rating. From my perspective, the show possesses its own distinctive charm, and I particularly appreciate the implementation of CGI and the cast's performances. With the hope of a second season, it's important to acknowledge that the show diverges from the original anime but maintains its own intrinsic value.

"Being a pirate is the best thing!You have the wind in your back, the salty sea air, your loyal crew by your side.You never know what's in the horizon.Its all about being free!","Epic live adaptation of the masterpiece by the brilliant mind of Eiichiro Oda, stands as a beacon of excellence in the realm of anime and manga. This sprawling tale of adventure, camaraderie, and unyielding dreams has left an indelible mark on the hearts of fans worldwide. As a devoted follower of the Straw Hat Pirates and their riveting journey, I find it impossible to convey the sheer brilliance of One Piece in mere words, but I'll endeavor to capture the essence of its magic.

At its core, this series is a celebration of the human spirit and the pursuit of one's dreams. The protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy, embodies the relentless pursuit of freedom and adventure. His infectious enthusiasm and unwavering determination set the tone for the entire series. Luffy's journey, from a wide-eyed dreamer with a straw hat to a formidable force to be reckoned with, is a testament to the transformative power of resilience and friendship.

The strength of One Piece lies not only in its charismatic lead but also in the ensemble cast that forms the Straw Hat crew. Each member, from the brooding swordsman Roronoa Zoro to the navigating wizard Nami, contributes a unique flavor to the narrative. Oda's genius lies in his ability to weave individual character arcs seamlessly into the overarching plot, creating a tapestry of stories that resonate with the audience on a deeply personal level. As a fan, witnessing the growth, struggles, and triumphs of these characters is a profoundly moving experience.

The world-building in the drama is nothing short of extraordinary. Oda has constructed a vast and intricately connected universe that spans across seas, islands, and cultures. The Grand Line, the New World, and the mysteries of the One Piece itself serve as a backdrop to the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates. The richness of this world is a testament to Oda's unparalleled creativity, and it invites fans to immerse themselves in a realm where every island holds a new mystery and every sea promises untold dangers.

The narrative unfolds like a carefully orchestrated symphony, with arcs that range from heart-wrenching to hilariously absurd. From every emotional rollercoaster, each saga leaves an indelible mark on the viewer's soul. Oda's ability to balance intense action, emotional depth, and humor is a testament to his storytelling prowess. The layers of intrigue, alliances, and rivalries add a complexity that keeps fans eagerly anticipating the next twist in the tale.

Beyond the action-packed sequences and intricate plotlines, One Piece carries profound themes that resonate universally. Friendship, freedom, justice, and the pursuit of one's dreams are recurring motifs that give the series a depth beyond its entertaining surface. The camaraderie among the Straw Hat crew, forged through shared hardships and victories, is a poignant reminder of the strength found in genuine connections. The series doesn't shy away from addressing societal issues and moral quandaries, adding a layer of thought-provoking substance that elevates it to a higher plane.

Visually, One Piece is a feast for the eyes. Awesome effects, fight choreography and expressive characters, brings the world to life with vibrant energy. The action sequences are a ballet of dynamic movements, and the emotional beats are conveyed with a subtlety that speaks volumes. Oda's attention to detail, whether in designing mythical creatures or crafting the intricate architecture of islands, enhances the immersive experience for fans.

In conclusion, One Piece is not merely a manga or anime; it's a cultural phenomenon that has touched the hearts of millions. Eiichiro Oda's opus is a celebration of the human spirit, a testament to the power of dreams, and a journey that transcends the boundaries of fiction. For those who have embarked on this grand adventure, this series is more than a story - it's a treasure trove of emotions, life lessons, and a legacy that will endure for generations to come.",01-Oct-23,10.0,epic live adaptation masterpiece brilliant mind eiichiro oda stands beacon excellence realm anime manga sprawling tale adventure camaraderie unyielding dreams left indelible mark hearts fans worldwide devoted follower straw hat pirates riveting journey find impossible convey sheer brilliance one piece mere words ill endeavor capture essence magic core series celebration human spirit pursuit ones dreams protagonist monkey luffy embodies relentless pursuit freedom adventure infectious enthusiasm unwavering determination set tone entire series luffys journey wideeyed dreamer straw hat formidable force reckoned testament transformative power resilience friendship strength one piece lies charismatic lead also ensemble cast forms straw hat crew member brooding swordsman roronoa zoro navigating wizard nami contributes unique flavor narrative odas genius lies ability weave individual character arcs seamlessly overarching plot creating tapestry stories resonate audience deeply personal level fan witnessing growth struggles triumphs characters profoundly moving experience worldbuilding drama nothing short extraordinary oda constructed vast intricately connected universe spans across seas islands cultures grand line new world mysteries one piece serve backdrop adventures straw hat pirates richness world testament odas unparalleled creativity invites fans immerse realm every island holds new mystery every sea promises untold dangers narrative unfolds like carefully orchestrated symphony arcs range heartwrenching hilariously absurd every emotional rollercoaster saga leaves indelible mark viewers soul odas ability balance intense action emotional depth humor testament storytelling prowess layers intrigue alliances rivalries add complexity keeps fans eagerly anticipating next twist tale beyond actionpacked sequences intricate plotlines one piece carries profound themes resonate universally friendship freedom justice pursuit ones dreams recurring motifs give series depth beyond entertaining surface camaraderie among straw hat crew forged shared hardships victories poignant reminder strength found genuine connections series doesnt shy away addressing societal issues moral quandaries adding layer thoughtprovoking substance elevates higher plane visually one piece feast eyes awesome effects fight choreography expressive characters brings world life vibrant energy action sequences ballet dynamic movements emotional beats conveyed subtlety speaks volumes odas attention detail whether designing mythical creatures crafting intricate architecture islands enhances immersive experience fans conclusion one piece merely manga anime cultural phenomenon touched hearts millions eiichiro odas opus celebration human spirit testament power dreams journey transcends boundaries fiction embarked grand adventure series story treasure trove emotions life lessons legacy endure generations come
What a surprise!!,"It was awesome and it did make me feel the emotions they were trying to portray. Overall it was great and it almost blew my socks off and the experience was very enjoyable. As an anime fan I do not know why they had to cut Hachi though. That is the only change I disagree with, even though I understand the CGI would have been rather difficult to nail. My favorite portrayal was Nami's, she was the one who was the most attached to the crew and made me believe they cared for each other the most.

Perfect,Having watched a good portion of One Piece anime this show is exactly what you'd hope for! The outrageousness of the anime is truly on display in this live action and you wouldn't want it any other way. My sold issue with this show and it's not even the shows fault but the limited amount of episodes for season 1 is truly disappointing. So many of this new seasons are going to 8 episodes or so which is the companies fault. There are numerous shows that would have benefited so much if they could've had a few more episodes and for a anime show like this it DESERVES to have had more than just 8 to get started. Netflix scored on a perfection live action but burned us on limiting season 1 to only 8 episodes.,04-Sep-23,9.0,watched good portion one piece anime show exactly youd hope outrageousness anime truly display live action wouldnt want way sold issue show even shows fault limited amount episodes season truly disappointing many new seasons going episodes companies fault numerous shows would benefited much couldve episodes anime show like deserves get started netflix scored perfection live action burned us limiting season episodes
Glad I missed work to watch this 8 hour epic that breaks the mold,"I did not plan this, I was just at work, upset what was going on I ended up leaving early. Got home was wondering if I did the right thing, I felt pretty sure at the time but after reading a few upset messages I was unsure. Sooo I needed something to keep my mind off that and remembered this show. It didn't really sound great to be honest, the trailers looked alright.

I wasn't prepared to watch the first straight up masterpiece of a show that says 'Hell yea, Anime can work"". Its comedy is effective, its drama very hitting, its action was great. It also surprised me a lot. Blood? Death? Drinking? Cursing? Smoking? Wow, I mean it is in the manga (Death not so much) but WOW. They actually took all the silly themes, costumes, and set pieces incredible serious. It was also able to adapt the manga incredibly well without losing much. It was also very well paced, I was barely ever bored. It also had a great message, follow your dreams, don't let others beat you down and stand up for what you think is right, So ya, it did make me feel a lot better about my work situation.

Lost 8 hours of work to watch 8 hours of this and I'm feeling very satisfied before I'm off to bed.",31-Aug-23,10.0,plan work upset going ended leaving early got home wondering right thing felt pretty sure time reading upset messages unsure sooo needed something keep mind remembered show didnt really sound great honest trailers looked alright wasnt prepared watch first straight masterpiece show says hell yea anime work comedy effective drama hitting action great also surprised lot blood death drinking cursing smoking wow mean manga death much wow actually took silly themes costumes set pieces incredible serious also able adapt manga incredibly well without losing much also well paced barely ever bored also great message follow dreams dont let others beat stand think right ya make feel lot better work situation lost hours work watch hours im feeling satisfied im bed

One of the Most Creative & Original Shows EVER. A++++,"This is what Hollywood is suppose to be about. This show stands on talent - Talent from the writers in transferring from the original Anime to live actors & actresses. The direction is outstanding. A show that is FUN to watch with special effects done at the right time, not just thrown in because it can be. A show that Shanghai's you and keeps you. Adventure, Action, Drama, Comedy, and Mystery all rolled into one. No need for sex, cursing, or trying too hard to be funny, it's just PURE TALENT all the way around. A++++ in my opinion. I hope Netflix keeps this going until they find the One Piece.",05-Sep-23,10.0,hollywood suppose show stands talent talent writers transferring original anime live actors actresses direction outstanding show fun watch special effects done right time thrown show shanghais keeps adventure action drama comedy mystery rolled one need sex cursing trying hard funny pure talent way around opinion hope netflix keeps going find one piece
A new genre is born,"I'm in love. From the first episode I was instantly hooked. And it never let go. I spent 90% of the runtime with a smile on my face. It's visually stimulating with great action, creative fights, and amazing music (Buggy's theme music omg). I'm fully attached to ALL of the characters.

Most of the cast does a great job. But the one who fittingly drives the show is lead actor I√±aki Godoy. I've never seen him before, but he brings such exuberance to the role. You can't help but root for him and share in his emotions.

Speaking of emotions, this show evokes them like it's nothing. The many heartfelt moments hit hard, sometimes with only one episode of buildup. I teared up multiple times, both sad and happy.

For reference, I've never seen the One Piece anime and am not big into anime in general. But I watch tons of movies and TV shows, and usually check out any live-action anime adaptations. They are all, how do I put it, muy garbo (Dragonball Evolution smh). So I was absolutely stunned at how well they translated this.

With the exception of not being animation, it fully feels like I'm watching anime. It does something for the first time: bringing the most endearing aspects of anime into live-action. So many parts feel like they're done exactly how they were in the manga/anime. Like announcing the name of an attack or Luffy constantly smiling.

These parts would feel cheesy if the rest of the show was more like traditional Hollywood. But it's not. It's anime through and through. It feels like a new genre. Producers need to take note at how good it can be if done right. I'm confident that whoever made this (creators/writers/directors) love anime and love One Piece. It really shows.

I love this season. To say I can't wait for more would be a severe understatement. And if they keep this level of quality, I can see myself watching this for 10+ seasons. I really hope they don't wait too long in between. I need more now.

Good Adaptation,"One Piece is one heck of an anime series that eludes anyone adapting to live action. The amount of special effects would be ridiculous. With the rubbery moves and silliness, it's an expensive challenge to make.

Netflix' One Piece under the Japanese producers' watch eyes is a good adaptation. It might not be perfect, but from the storyline, casting and atory telling, it is One Piece.

The directors took 1-2 steps backwards in term of CGI is a wise decision. Season 1 focused on the main crew recruitment was pretty much exactly what initial One Piece episodes are.

Now that the main crew had been gathered, the series would face a much more difficult challenges due to the bigger crew recruitments and enemies.

The casting was impressive, each Straw Hat Pirate member was matched accordingly that when you're an old fan of One Piece, you woukd recognize them in an instant. While if you're a new audience, you'll enjoy how tight the Straw Hat Pirate crew was illustrated.

Good job, hopefully the 2nd season would up the ante.",10-Sep-23,8.0,one piece one heck anime series eludes anyone adapting live action amount special effects would ridiculous rubbery moves silliness expensive challenge make netflix one piece japanese producers watch eyes good adaptation might perfect storyline casting atory telling one piece directors took steps backwards term cgi wise decision season focused main crew recruitment pretty much exactly initial one piece episodes main crew gathered series would face much difficult challenges due bigger crew recruitments enemies casting impressive straw hat pirate member matched accordingly youre old fan one piece woukd recognize instant youre new audience youll enjoy tight straw hat pirate crew illustrated good job hopefully nd season would ante

What an absolute frenetic joy this show is,"Even with no knowledge of the original anime or manga, even going in pre-primed to cynically dump on it, this won me over within minutes.

Why? Because everyone involved, the writers, directors, set dressers, costumers, choreographers, and the title stars to the briefest of guest spot actors, are absolutely committed to it. None of it makes any sense, the milieu is bonkers, the close-in face-focused cinematography is deranged, but none of that matters because this show is just so much fun. Big, bold, unalloyed, unapologetic, basic, old fashioned fun.

Everything that I thought would irk me about it, like the nonsensical premise, the manic lead, the cocky independent grrlboss Nami, the pantomime villains, all of it works out, by careful design.

I tried, I really tried, to not enjoy it, but it just powered through and delivered scenes and a story and characters that are so fundamentally satisfying that I went from tolerance, to enjoyment to a fan within the first two densely packed episodes. And it only got better from there, with backstory and development and an absolutely astonishing character payoff in episode 7 that left me in tears at the pitch perfect writing and performances.

Magnificent Tv Series driven by awesome character üòéüòé! !,"Accidentally came across this tv series. First few minutes caught my interest. Ended up binge watching it in two days. The reason why this is an awesome tv series is because it has almost everything one needs to enjoy it fully. The characters, the story, the setting, the directions, the humour, the action. This is the whole nine yard.

There are many many awesome üòé characters that are memorable. Even after you finished watching it you feel like you needed it more. My personal favourite is Mihawk Dracule, Zoro, and the clown. It doesn't mean others are not great. I just liked them more.

I believe we will get to see more of them in Season two.",14-Sep-23,9.0,accidentally came across tv series first minutes caught interest ended binge watching two days reason awesome tv series almost everything one needs enjoy fully characters story setting directions humour action whole nine yard many many awesome characters memorable even finished watching feel like needed personal favourite mihawk dracule zoro clown doesnt mean others great liked believe get see season two
Sets the standard for live-action adaptations of manga and anime by staying true to the spirt of its beloved source material,"Set in a world of massive oceans dotted with various islands overseen by the power of the World Government, the series takes place in the midst of the Great Pirate Era started when King of the Pirates, Gold Roger (Michael Dorman) was executed but not before telling several witnesses all the treasure he'd collected known as the One Piece was anyone's to find which inspired countless pirates to take to the seas in search of it. One such aspiring pirate, Monkey D. Luffy (Inaki Godoy), who attained the attributes of rubber on his body after eating a Devil Fruit, sets off to the seas intent on becoming King of the Pirates by finding the One Piece and assembles a crew consisting of thief and navigator Nami (Emily Rudd), swordsman Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), boastful yet overly cautious sniper Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and fleet footed chef Sanji (Taz Skylar) to help him set sail for adventure as they face off against rival pirates as well as the World Government's Marines.

One Piece is a live-action adaptation of the shonen manga of the same name by Eiichiro Oda published since 1997 that has also served as the basis for the long running anime series that like its manga counterpart continues on to this day. Given the popularity of the franchise the worldover, development began in 2017 on a co-production with publisher Shueisha and Tomorrow Studios with the rights eventually picked up by Netflix. Given the spotty history of western adaptations of anime and manga properties there was understandably some concern from longtime fans and newcomers that the production staff and stars did a solid job of dispelling with a lot of transparency with the behind the scenes work and casting as well as Oda's personal involvement in the show. I'm pleased to say after all the buildup, the end result is about as pitch perfect as you can get that while not a 1:1 adaptation of the anime or manga still adheres to the spirit and characters in a manner that sets the bar for similar adaptations.

To start off, I am a fan of the series (though a relative newcomer) having watched roughly 380 episodes up to the conclusion of the Thriller Bark arc (at the time of this writing at least). One Piece remains one of the only long running serialized anime series I've been heavily engrossed in and still am and while I may not know as much as those who've followed the series from their 4Kids dub days (sorry for the reminder) I do have a reasonably firm grasp of the characters and stories including the roughly 50+ episodes of the East Blue arc this first season adapts. On a purely visual level, One Piece looks fantastic. While the series does have to scale back certain elements in order to adapt to live-action, the series finds smart workarounds and it never feels like the series is restrained by its budget as you still get that strong sense of worldbuilding and character you got from both the manga and the anime. The cast in particular deserve a ton of praise and they feel about as close to the real life embodiment of these larger than life characters as you could possible get. Inaki Godoy is fantastic as Luffy and he captures both the characters high energy and enthusiasm while also showing a natural penchant for that slightly goofy style of humor while also being able to move into more intense moments when the situation calls for it. The rest of the cast such as Rudd's Nami, Mackenyu's Zoro, Gibson's Usopp, and Taz Skylar's Sanji are no less impressive and have fantastic chemistry with each other.

The writing on the show is also very strong and this was definitely an area I was concerned about because when I learned they were compressing about 50 episodes worth of story into 8 one hour episodes I'll admit I was skeptical (even being aware of the ""tricks"" shonen anime indulge in to stretch runtimes and arcs). But the writers deserve props for adapting the material while also remixing certain elements so while it's not a full 1:1 recreation of the manga or anime, it still feels true to the characters and themes and like a ""remix"" made by those who like and understand the material. Even though this means taking certain plot points that weren't revealed until, the 250th episode mark in the show, they find a solid way of integrating it into the story with some particularly welcome expansion for Koby (Morgan Davies) and his relationship with Garp (Vincent Regan) and Helmeppo (Aidan Scott).

I really enjoyed One Piece and it left me really optimistic about the series going forward from here. While I'll admit there's probably some lingering skepticism on how they'll handle certain elements in the future (especially Tony Tony Chopper and other Zoan Type Devil Fruit users) the creative team and cast have done an excellent enough job that I'm confident they can do it.",02-Sep-23,9.0,set world massive oceans dotted various islands overseen power world government series takes place midst great pirate era started king pirates gold roger michael dorman executed telling several witnesses treasure hed collected known one piece anyones find inspired countless pirates take seas search one aspiring pirate monkey luffy inaki godoy attained attributes rubber body eating devil fruit sets seas intent becoming king pirates finding one piece assembles crew consisting thief navigator nami emily rudd swordsman roronoa zoro mackenyu boastful yet overly cautious sniper usopp jacob romero gibson fleet footed chef sanji taz skylar help set sail adventure face rival pirates well world governments marines one piece liveaction adaptation shonen manga name eiichiro oda published since also served basis long running anime series like manga counterpart continues day given popularity franchise worldover development began coproduction publisher shueisha tomorrow studios rights eventually picked netflix given spotty history western adaptations anime manga properties understandably concern longtime fans newcomers production staff stars solid job dispelling lot transparency behind scenes work casting well odas personal involvement show im pleased say buildup end result pitch perfect get adaptation anime manga still adheres spirit characters manner sets bar similar adaptations start fan series though relative newcomer watched roughly episodes conclusion thriller bark arc time writing least one piece remains one long running serialized anime series ive heavily engrossed still may know much whove followed series kids dub days sorry reminder reasonably firm grasp characters stories including roughly episodes east blue arc first season adapts purely visual level one piece looks fantastic series scale back certain elements order adapt liveaction series finds smart workarounds never feels like series restrained budget still get strong sense worldbuilding character got manga anime cast particular deserve ton praise feel close real life embodiment larger life characters could possible get inaki godoy fantastic luffy captures characters high energy enthusiasm also showing natural penchant slightly goofy style humor also able move intense moments situation calls rest cast rudds nami mackenyus zoro gibsons usopp taz skylars sanji less impressive fantastic chemistry writing show also strong definitely area concerned learned compressing episodes worth story one hour episodes ill admit skeptical even aware tricks shonen anime indulge stretch runtimes arcs writers deserve props adapting material also remixing certain elements full recreation manga anime still feels true characters themes like remix made like understand material even though means taking certain plot points werent revealed th episode mark show find solid way integrating story particularly welcome expansion koby morgan davies relationship garp vincent regan helmeppo aidan scott really enjoyed one piece left really optimistic series going forward ill admit theres probably lingering skepticism theyll handle certain elements future especially tony tony chopper zoan type devil fruit users creative team cast done excellent enough job im confident
Netflix's One Piece: A Good Production That's Not My Style,"I've never seen the original anime, even though I like fantasy and sci-fi genres.

But I couldn't get into the comedy tone and the overall feel of this live-action adaptation, even after watching more than half of the season. It just didn't appeal to me.

I don't want to be harsh on this production, because it's well-done. It has heart, likable actors, and good quality overall. And I do think that Netflix has a potential winner here, which many fans of the anime, and maybe some newcomers, will love and applaud.

But I'm someone who prefers content that's more serious, even if just a bit. The tone of this series is too nonsensical for my taste. It's typical of certain animes, which I never enjoyed. But many others did.

If you like hyperbolic and juvenile narratives, this could be for you. Otherwise, give it a try for the first 3 episodes. If you're still not hooked, it's probably not worth the binge.",31-Aug-23,7.0,ive never seen original anime even though like fantasy scifi genres couldnt get comedy tone overall feel liveaction adaptation even watching half season didnt appeal dont want harsh production welldone heart likable actors good quality overall think netflix potential winner many fans anime maybe newcomers love applaud im someone prefers content thats serious even bit tone series nonsensical taste typical certain animes never enjoyed many others like hyperbolic juvenile narratives could otherwise give try first episodes youre still hooked probably worth binge
Not bad not perfect,"I think they did the best they could with what they had, and I was really scared to even start it cuz the trailer just looked so corny. Like 2000's power rangers or something similar. But I just HAD to check it out and I think my low expectations actually helped lol cuz it wasn't actually that bad! I'm not finished but so far it's really just what you can expect with these actors/director. I mean did u really think we'd have a OP live action starring Brad Pitt as zoro?! What were you expecting lol it is what it is...and it was surprisingly decent. I was worried the actor who portrays luffy wouldn't be able to pull of luffys silly goofy charm (mixed with his powerful side of course) but he does pretty well. The rest are like I said, power ranger characters. Buggy however, is quite good and I really enjoyed his episode. The most annoying issue however is the costume and character design. For example: Although shanks' acting isn't the worst, he is definitely no OnePiece shanks. He doesn't have his powerful and scruffy badass pirate-y character....he's just a different character completely unlike the anime shanks. I say he's not ""bad"" cuz someone watching who has never seen onepiece will probably think he's just a chill, older-bro-to-luffy type pirate, but that's not the real shanks at all. And don't get me started on the hair. The hair must change. It's the worst. The wigs/hair coloring on every single character is terrible and is the reason I cringed so much watching the trailer. Is it a big deal? I think so because costume design can turn a film from 0 to 10 and in this series it falls to a 1/10 to me. It's because it weighs so much on the visuals as you fall in love with characters and then you see this ridiculous wig with horrible coloring and it just takes all the life away from the character.

Hmmmm what else shall I say? I guess I'll just leave it at this...It wasn't too bad. I would definitely recommend this to ppl who haven't seen onepiece and then catch back up in the anime where the series leaves off. The best arcs are not in this series but of course you gotta start somewhere.

Edit: well I finished it and I still stand by my review. I really liked it and I think the main reason is cuz I'm seeing one of my fave shows come to life and it was enjoyable. The fight scenes are not dragged out yet still thrilling.

Live action is the best in the live action industryThe photography and editing are undoubtedly impressive and at a very high level, the actors are also good, the casting is very good Oda, the creator of One Piece worked really hard, you should make this live action something special and in my opinion he did it and succeeded

I'm conflicted....,"Long time fan of one piece and know pretty much everything about one piece and some rabbit hole fan theories to boot. So my perspective is from that angle.

With that out the way... There is a great deal I enjoyed about this series. But to keep things simple it's best I just list pros-cons.

+ cast is outstanding üëè
The writing is sloppy
+ The acting is amazing
The direction is sloppy
+ The action is awesome
why is Luffy so weak?


+ the CGI is amazing, and some scenes are breathtaking and capture the essence one piece.


The videography feels like college students D movie with pointless angles and motion...
+ Den Den mushi are f#@¬£¬£ing hilarious üòÇ
music is crap in most places and should have reused some more original score rather than generic hollywood trumpets and orchestra.


+ Some story changes actually made sense.


some changes might mess up future plotlines
+ Garp is awesome
Why is Koby getting so much screen time?


+ Mihawk and Shanks nailed it.


again why is Luffy so weak?


+ Zoro got lost
failed to carry over other jokes
+ I loved Kaya and Usopp
Kuro episode was a drag.


+ Going merry looks great
except it's gaping wide mouth
+ perfectly balance adult themes and goofiness
could have been more graphic in some scenes and needed more blood.


+ Sanji and Zoro yes....

There are other things I'd liked to have seen including the unique laughs... You kinda hear them sometimes but fails to hit. This was especially important for arlong in this period.

Some info was revealed very early too which makes me wonder how they will bridge later events should the series go the whole length.

Overall I enjoyed it, but it's clear the team making the series don't know how to use the budget they have correctly, the poor videography, directing and writing is CLEARLY being carried by the existing story and great acting, which is embarrassing tbh.",02-Sep-23,7.0,long time fan one piece know pretty much everything one piece rabbit hole fan theories boot perspective angle way great deal enjoyed series keep things simple best list proscons cast outstanding writing sloppy acting amazing direction sloppy action awesome luffy weak cgi amazing scenes breathtaking capture essence one piece videography feels like college students movie pointless angles motion den den mushi fing hilarious music crap places reused original score rather generic hollywood trumpets orchestra story changes actually made sense changes might mess future plotlines garp awesome koby getting much screen time mihawk shanks nailed luffy weak zoro got lost failed carry jokes loved kaya usopp kuro episode drag going merry looks great except gaping wide mouth perfectly balance adult themes goofiness could graphic scenes needed blood sanji zoro yes things id liked seen including unique laughs kinda hear sometimes fails hit especially important arlong period info revealed early makes wonder bridge later events series go whole length overall enjoyed clear team making series dont know use budget correctly poor videography directing writing clearly carried existing story great acting embarrassing tbh
beautiful.,"As someone that has been a fan for many years, i was skeptical with how this adaptation would turn out. However, this live action proves itself that good adaptations can be done, and WELL. The production design, costuming, and sets are stunning created, and feel alive.

Almost,"I still have a few episodes left but I'm liking the weird quirkiness of this. I watched the partial trailer scrolling by before it came out and put it in my list. To be honest I didn't think i was going to like it but I was wrong. So far it's been extremely funny, exciting and entertaining! I like several of the actors and the guy who does buggy is really good. I kept trying to guess who he was. His laugh sounded like Gustaf Skarsgard but then I could tell it wasn't him the longer his scene went. I don't know how the H#ck there's over 300 reviews when it just came out!!?!

"""The might of my Fishman Karate""","As far as Netflix adaptations go, this is beyond decent and worth a watch. I'd be glad to watch a new season.

While I have my issues, and the manga is still THE way to consume One Piece (by being MUCH more enjoyable, exciting, detailed, stylish, takes its time to pace its developments properly with payoffs that make worth reading).. the excellent camerawork, sound mixing, good choreographies and CGI, faithful and gorgeous sets and locations, colors, clothing and much more makes this one of the best productions I've seen in a while. And the supporting cast (Shanks, Buggy, Garp, etc) is definitely my favorite part.

And for a 1 hour 8 Episode Season, it accomplishes plenty. Which makes this an easy recommendation!!

Now!

1. I don't like this Luffy, which feels like different character.. and he IS supposed to be the driving force of One Piece. His goals and approach are there, and the physical acting is good. But in the manga, he is more of an unstoppable ""Typhoon"" than a nuisance. Is also more level-headed and not as dim-witted as portrayed. I√±aki's delivery is not my cup of tea either.. Luffy TO ME is very different.

2. Then there's also a big problem with the show's pacing.. And while I like the ending of the season, they rushed towards it and many things pay for it. For example, Arlong's threat does not feel as big, nor is Luffy's accomplishment by taking him down and finally earning a Bounty.

3. Then there's the rest of the main crew.. they feel too stoic and ""normal"", which sometimes makes me feel like I'm watching a generic drama. Their delivery is too dull for what it should be. And the base of their relationships isn't formed the same way (just like these showrunners did with Cowboy Beebop.. they again decided to mix the big three from the start). Zoro calls him ""confident in a way that rubs off"", but someone that hasn't read the source material can't really pinpoint from the episodes at that point.

It's the little things that add up. And the resulting dish is completely different.

Sure, they get ""there"" in the end, but it isn't as organic. For example, in the manga, Luffy's first encounter with the Marines results in him liberating the islanders from the corrupt Officials. This helps paint the world in a way.. a well as what Luffy does and why, and how people see him (even the rest of the good Marines that let him go). They adapt it and change it to their liking, into a good product, but just not the same I initially fell for.

Highly Entertaining,"I had no idea of what I was about to watch other than some kind of fantastical old earth with equally fantastical people, some of which are dreaded pirates. This series flat out entertains with colorful characters aplenty, more than several of which a viewer can invest in. The realization of the fantasy world is quite good. Most of the times the ""creatures"" look good too. The ride though is the story and its central character Loofy. Loofy , in spite of the fact they're hunted...or, maybe because, wants to be a pirate from his youngest recollections. Season one is his journey from a youth to a wanted man and it's never boring. I think there's six episodes and I was so enthralled with One Piece I watched it straight through. This elicits suspension of belief much like early Star Wars. In fact, it's more entertaining than ""most"" (i.e. Not all) of the latter Star Wars universe for this viewer.

"""I'm Monkey D. Luffy. And I will be King of the Pirates.""","(490-word review) I only read up to 185 chapters in the manga a few years ago, and that was done casually, while I've been reading the recent ones as they're being released for months now or maybe closer to a year: still done casually. Either way, even if the opposite was true and I have read all of it, in addition to reading it week-by-week, I'm not in the position to have an appropriately concrete opinion on whether or not this show is a faithful and well-done adaptation because of the casual, skimming-through nature of reading it.

I can, however, from viewing it as itself, say it's great on every front. As long as you're not hastily judgemental about the initial appearance of the opposite, at least on a surface level, you can tell they put money into this show, minus the spectacle and spectacularity with its presentation you could potentially be accustomed to and likely expected from this show - the world they've built/the worldbuilding that's been done already is noticeable and remarkable, most notably through the sets and set design, and the practicality of constructing/building the ships; more importantly, you can see the effort that went into this, and you can feel the palpable genuity of care and passion that those involved with its creation (and bringing-to-life of everything) possess.

The script/pacing was straight to the point but plentiful with a good amount of stuff happening at all times, nicely compacted and efficient; most of the characters and their characterizations, especially all of the Straw Hat crew, were great, further complimented by the performances of those particular characters, though some of the other performances were weaker; the cinematography was consistently excellent, while the various instances of VFX and CGI looked flawless enough at first glance (the bounty posters - which were a fantastic addition and I hope that continues - the stretchiness of Luffy's powers, and the sea beast, stood out the most) was the same way. And, of course, the score was outstanding.

If this level of quality is maintained with the next season and, hopefully, seasons more concerning these angles and aspects, topped with the return, and hopefully lasting involvement, of Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli, as their score was phenomenal and contributed significantly to every scene (their departure from The Witcher was crazy; there's no way they made that decision themselves - whatever happened behind the scenes, especially if they were replaced with intention/fired - only someone like Lauren Schmidt Hissrich would do that with composers of their skill - better not happen here), that's about the best sign possible of the continued up-and-coming success story of this show. Netflix could have something special on its hands for the ages, a flagship series, provided they take a leap of faith with it - the ball is in their court. It's now a matter of playing their cards right: making beneficial and correct decisions.

unexpectedly good,"First of all, I wasn't expecting the TV series to be an exact replica of the manga. After all, we have the animated version spanning over 1080 episodes, which provides ample room for creative interpretation. In this review, I'll be delving into the plot, casting choices, and special effects that make this adaptation stand out.

To begin with, the plot is the backbone of any successful series, and in this regard, the adaptation exceeded my expectations. While it might not adhere to every detail of the manga, it manages to capture the essence and spirit that fans have come to love. The pacing feels just right, allowing for character development, exciting battles, and the exploration of the One Piece world without feeling rushed.

Casting is a crucial factor that can make or break an adaptation, and in this case, the casting choices were spot on. The actors chosen to portray the beloved characters fit their roles like a glove. Luffy's character is brought to life by an actor who perfectly embodies his guffy and inspiring nature, just as depicted in the manga. This level of authenticity helps bridge the gap between the two mediums and adds an extra layer of enjoyment for fans.

One aspect that truly impressed me was the attention to detail in the portrayal of the villains. A critical component of any series or movie is the ability to make the audience connect with the antagonists, and in this adaptation, they succeeded admirably. Characters like Captain Kuro, Buggy, and Arlong are not just mere villains; they're complex characters with their own motives and personalities. This depth makes the conflicts more engaging and the world more immersive, as the viewers can see beyond the surface and understand what drives these characters.

Moving on to the special effects, modern technology has allowed for a visual spectacle that enhances the overall viewing experience. The vibrant and colorful world of One Piece, with its diverse landscapes and fantastical creatures, is brought to life with impressive CGI and practical effects. From the sprawling seas to the bustling cities, every aspect of the world feels authentic and visually captivating.

In conclusion, the TV series adaptation of One Piece managed to exceed my expectations on multiple fronts. While it's not an exact copy of the manga, it retains the core essence and charm that has made One Piece a beloved franchise. The well-crafted plot, impeccable casting choices, and impressive special effects come together to create a series that does justice to its source material while standing on its own merits. As a fan of both the manga and the animated version, I can confidently say that this adaptation is a worthy addition to the One Piece legacy.",31-Aug-23,10.0,first wasnt expecting tv series exact replica manga animated version spanning episodes provides ample room creative interpretation review ill delving plot casting choices special effects make adaptation stand begin plot backbone successful series regard adaptation exceeded expectations might adhere every detail manga manages capture essence spirit fans come love pacing feels right allowing character development exciting battles exploration one piece world without feeling rushed casting crucial factor make break adaptation case casting choices spot actors chosen portray beloved characters fit roles like glove luffys character brought life actor perfectly embodies guffy inspiring nature depicted manga level authenticity helps bridge gap two mediums adds extra layer enjoyment fans one aspect truly impressed attention detail portrayal villains critical component series movie ability make audience connect antagonists adaptation succeeded admirably characters like captain kuro buggy arlong mere villains theyre complex characters motives personalities depth makes conflicts engaging world immersive viewers see beyond surface understand drives characters moving special effects modern technology allowed visual spectacle enhances overall viewing experience vibrant colorful world one piece diverse landscapes fantastical creatures brought life impressive cgi practical effects sprawling seas bustling cities every aspect world feels authentic visually captivating conclusion tv series adaptation one piece managed exceed expectations multiple fronts exact copy manga retains core essence charm made one piece beloved franchise wellcrafted plot impeccable casting choices impressive special effects come together create series justice source material standing merits fan manga animated version confidently say adaptation worthy addition one piece legacy
It feels like One Piece,"While the live action adaptation of One Piece does not shy away from taking creative liberties, by removing or changing plot points, it still perfectly captures the essence and tone of the original story. The world is sufficiently strange and intriguing, and the special effects, mostly, do not feel out of place or distracting. A 90% score might seem a bit too high when compared to other well received shows, like Breaking Bad or the first few seasons of Game of Thrones, but rating OPLA for what it is: an adaptation of the One Piece manga, I can think of very few concrete changes to improve it, so by that metric it is indeed almost perfect.",31-Aug-23,9.0,live action adaptation one piece shy away taking creative liberties removing changing plot points still perfectly captures essence tone original story world sufficiently strange intriguing special effects mostly feel place distracting score might seem bit high compared well received shows like breaking bad first seasons game thrones rating opla adaptation one piece manga think concrete changes improve metric indeed almost perfect
Better than feared with still some room for improvement,"Let me preface this review by stating that I've been following the Anime and Manga on and off for over 20 years and I love the world created and always hoped for a live action remake since I've always thought that the original has pacing issues. However, the East Blue Arc I always liked for it's tight pacing.

Now getting to this version. There's some small changes story wise but nothing that would change the narrative of it in a significant way. There's some added artificial tension between the characters here and there which seemed a little bit annoying but overall it's alright. The story in general is however a proven commodity.

The script is well done with some good dialogues in it. The set design is great. You can see the love for the world. The fight choreography is really good when it's two people actually fighting in real life without CGI. There's room to grow however when Luffy is fighting.

The main cast is simply amazing and they deliver it. Especially the guy depicting Zoro seems perfect. The demeanor and his delivery is on point and his fights are the best because it seems most realistic when he's doing it.

While the main cast's acting is great some of the minor characters' is bad. Instantly remembering the three Black Cat Pirates, Alvida or Nami's sister.

And then there's the costumes. Since this is a fictional world I have no problem with modern style clothing since the original story makes an effort to purposely be ambiguous about the time setting and it's technology/ society, but here the problem is that the costumes look very cheap like plastic and more importantly like clothes from mass production which completely contradicts the world. The costumes looked like those 1$ shop clothes which is really taking you out of the show's story.

The music is ok, but it's a wee bit too similar to the Witcher which isn't that surprising since it's by the same composers.

Overall a very competent first season that needs a little improvement in some areas. I very much do look forward to a second season.",01-Sep-23,7.0,let preface review stating ive following anime manga years love world created always hoped live action remake since ive always thought original pacing issues however east blue arc always liked tight pacing getting version theres small changes story wise nothing would change narrative significant way theres added artificial tension characters seemed little bit annoying overall alright story general however proven commodity script well done good dialogues set design great see love world fight choreography really good two people actually fighting real life without cgi theres room grow however luffy fighting main cast simply amazing deliver especially guy depicting zoro seems perfect demeanor delivery point fights best seems realistic hes main casts acting great minor characters bad instantly remembering three black cat pirates alvida namis sister theres costumes since fictional world problem modern style clothing since original story makes effort purposely ambiguous time setting technology society problem costumes look cheap like plastic importantly like clothes mass production completely contradicts world costumes looked like shop clothes really taking shows story music ok wee bit similar witcher isnt surprising since composers overall competent first season needs little improvement areas much look forward second season
"Terrible consume design, so so acting","Never heard of the anime equivalent and I'm not interested in it, so I'm reviewing it as its own thing.

I don't think I ever objected against costume design, but holy damn this is bad. A kid wearing a printed shirt, everyone wearing clothing with zero wear and tear, clean fashionable hats. What on Earth were they thinking?

The acting ranges from okay to terrible/kiddie like. I guess it's meant to be a style - light, cartoony and humorous, but then what about the gore of seeing a man split in half? I would like to take the world that's portrayed seriously, please. Lighthearted is fine, poor acting and inconsistent direction is not.

Not sure what to think but I'll watch one or two more episodes to see if things improve....",02-Sep-23,5.0,never heard anime equivalent im interested im reviewing thing dont think ever objected costume design holy damn bad kid wearing printed shirt everyone wearing clothing zero wear tear clean fashionable hats earth thinking acting ranges okay terriblekiddie like guess meant style light cartoony humorous gore seeing man split half would like take world thats portrayed seriously please lighthearted fine poor acting inconsistent direction sure think ill watch one two episodes see things improve

From the Perspective of a LONG time One Piece fan,"Welp, I climbed aboard with all my hopes and dreams andddd the Netflix live adaptation of One Piece is a mixed bag if you're a fan of the series looking for a faithful adaptation of the manga. I wasn't expecting it to be perfect by any means. Even the anime takes significant creative liberty with the source material. I have read the manga week to week since the beginning of the Alabasta arc, which amounts to about twenty years or so. I've read the chapter the moment it drops every week. I have all the volumes. I've participated in online discussion everywhere from ArlongPark forums to reddit for years. I have more merch than any one person should have. Therefore I'm going to be inherently more particular about a series that has been such a big part of my life and anyone should take the following with a grain of salt, especially if you're new to One Piece. It's entirely possible if this is your first time consuming One Piece in any way, you'll have a great time since even a skewed version of One Piece is still great because the story itself is incredible. So, how is it?

I'll start with the positives. The backgrounds are way better than I expected. Most of them, with a few exceptions, look fantastic. It's surreal seeing East Blue come to life. The actors are clearly trying their best and if anyone followed the production updates, they did a lot to prepare for their roles. Some of the live action characters nailed their looks too, especially random characters like Genzo. They also made sure to include and emphasize a lot of the fan favorite moments like the ""Help me"" scene and ""the walk."" The biggest positive is still the story. The base characters and plot of One Piece are its biggest strengths and it only gets better from after where this adaptation leaves off.

Unfortunately, for me, there's a lot more noticeable negatives. The CGI is pretty horrid. They were tasked with a tough ask with animating a live action, rubber boy, but it's pretty jarring and could have been better. The acting and/or dialogue is just very off and doesn't quite capture the feel of One Piece. As I said, the actors clearly gave it their all, but it feels very strange having Luffy and Zoro make Marvel-esque quips to each other. I'm not sure if they felt like Western audiences wouldn't like the regular One Piece humor, but that's part of what makes the series special and it's just ruined here. Luffy is also FAR too self-aware. I know the ""I'm sensing some tension"" line from the trailer was memed a lot in pre-release and there's a lot of that here. There's a lot of Luffy lines that take away from his unique character and turn him more or less into a standard protagonist. Although a lot of characters look great. Some....do not. Arlong looks very bizarre. Again, a tough ask to bring him to life, but he looks sort of ridiculous. Nami's wig is... interesting. Another problem is a lot of parts from the plot are just cut entirely. I know they only have eight episodes and wanted to cover a lot of the series, but there's quite a lot of important-ish moments just missing.

I don't want to rag on the show too much, because unlike many other anime adaptations (cough Death Note, Dragonball, etc.), an effort was clearly made here. It certainly isn't unwatchable or horrible by any means. Some of it is One Piece is just next to impossible to adapt to live action. Some of it is some things were just cut to fit the time or budget allotted. Some of it was probably the studio forcing them to include Marvel type humor and other things that would have mainstream appeal. I can't pretend like the show is garbage, but I also can't pretend like it's perfect. I have literally no idea how this will be received by fans or newcomers to the series. As I mentioned earlier, I can see people who are not existing fans having a really good time with this since they don't know anything else when it comes to the series. It's possible it finds a new audience and does pretty well. It's also possible some existing fans enjoy it even though it's a watered down version just because it's a different medium. I'm not here to knock anyone who enjoyed it. I'm sure people will be mad at the average review who are invested in it.

However, if I'm giving it an honest review, this is really hard to rate. I feel like there's more bad than good, but given the low bar of live action anime adaptations, I'm just going to split the difference and call it 5/10. The effort is there, but a lot about it just doesn't work to capture the magic of the series. My sincerest advice for anyone that watched this or is interested in watching this is to read the manga. You can get a Shonen Jump subscription for dirt cheap and read it all. I've converted many people to read the series and every person gets hooked. The story has some of the best characters, world-building, etc. Of any series out there and I'd highly, highly recommend it. Just know this adaptation may not elicit the same excitement and emotions that the manga does. If you're an existing fan regardless of if you share my opinion, an even more negative one, or loved this adaptation, try to remember we're all nakama and want the best for the series even if we don't see eye to eye exactly on every aspect of the live action version.",31-Aug-23,5.0,welp climbed aboard hopes dreams andddd netflix live adaptation one piece mixed bag youre fan series looking faithful adaptation manga wasnt expecting perfect means even anime takes significant creative liberty source material read manga week week since beginning alabasta arc amounts twenty years ive read chapter moment drops every week volumes ive participated online discussion everywhere arlongpark forums reddit years merch one person therefore im going inherently particular series big part life anyone take following grain salt especially youre new one piece entirely possible first time consuming one piece way youll great time since even skewed version one piece still great story incredible ill start positives backgrounds way better expected exceptions look fantastic surreal seeing east blue come life actors clearly trying best anyone followed production updates lot prepare roles live action characters nailed looks especially random characters like genzo also made sure include emphasize lot fan favorite moments like help scene walk biggest positive still story base characters plot one piece biggest strengths gets better adaptation leaves unfortunately theres lot noticeable negatives cgi pretty horrid tasked tough ask animating live action rubber boy pretty jarring could better acting andor dialogue doesnt quite capture feel one piece said actors clearly gave feels strange luffy zoro make marvelesque quips im sure felt like western audiences wouldnt like regular one piece humor thats part makes series special ruined luffy also far selfaware know im sensing tension line trailer memed lot prerelease theres lot theres lot luffy lines take away unique character turn less standard protagonist although lot characters look great somedo arlong looks bizarre tough ask bring life looks sort ridiculous namis wig interesting another problem lot parts plot cut entirely know eight episodes wanted cover lot series theres quite lot importantish moments missing dont want rag show much unlike many anime adaptations cough death note dragonball etc effort clearly made certainly isnt unwatchable horrible means one piece next impossible adapt live action things cut fit time budget allotted probably studio forcing include marvel type humor things would mainstream appeal cant pretend like show garbage also cant pretend like perfect literally idea received fans newcomers series mentioned earlier see people existing fans really good time since dont know anything else comes series possible finds new audience pretty well also possible existing fans enjoy even though watered version different medium im knock anyone enjoyed im sure people mad average review invested however im giving honest review really hard rate feel like theres bad good given low bar live action anime adaptations im going split difference call effort lot doesnt work capture magic series sincerest advice anyone watched interested watching read manga get shonen jump subscription dirt cheap read ive converted many people read series every person gets hooked story best characters worldbuilding etc series id highly highly recommend know adaptation may elicit excitement emotions manga youre existing fan regardless share opinion even negative one loved adaptation try remember nakama want best series even dont see eye eye exactly every aspect live action version
I have not been disappointed,"I see the first chapter and although they change the story to how it is shown in the anime, it is entertaining and I have good expectations of the other chapters.

"With a good script, you can't go wrong","I was never a fan of the anime series frankly because I was never huge anime fan. I do appreciate things like Ghost in the Shell, Akira and some of Miyiazaki's creations but overall I am not big on animated movies, from Japan or the US. I just like live action.

So when I saw they were making a live action series of One Piece I thought I would give it a shot because the fans of the series are crazy about it, and I was hoping to understand why.

Turns out that the reason is the obvious: it's a beautiful story full of meanings. Sometimes it reminds you of Antoine de Saint Exupery's Little Prince, sometimes it reminds you of Tolkien, but mostly it is full of great notions and ideas, wonderfully depicted and serving as excellent lessons for children and young adults: believe in your dreams. Sacrifice for what you believe in. Love your friends. So what's good for those you love even if it is the hard thing to do.

All this may sound simplistic the way I describe it but it is delivered and described in an excellent manner in the story of Monkey D Luffy and his dream of being a pirate. It is such a basic and simple concept and yet so beautifully written.

All the rest, ie acting, CGI, similarity of the live action actors to the anime characters etc are in my opinion secondary and not particularly important. The overall look and feel is pretty fake but this is deliberate and clearly based on the anime. But it really does not matter at all. This is all about the story, the excellent dialogue and the beautiful messages it conveys to kids of all ages.

I hope and wish Hollywood would spend a little more time focusing on telling great stories that are so touching and can shape a young person's life like One Piece.

It's definitely worth more than most of the scifi and fantasy crap being released all the time that tell the same old story but with different visual effects or superpowers.

Overall, a very entertaining and thought provoking series that should be watched by everyone.

Very good adaptation,"From watching previous attempts at adapting anime I have to assume that it very difficult to do as very few of them have succeeded so far, but one piece definitely did.

The show is weird and wacky and the tone is equivalent to its anime counterpart, but everything about it feels that it fit's the setting and world that they are trying to create. Nothing feels out of place for the world they are trying to portray.

The main cast all did a wonderful job portraying their characters, and the major secondary cast (the previous generation) were even better. Mihawk and Zoro were my favourites, but I think I may be partial to the sword carrying variety of characters.

It's not perfect but it's not terrible either,Review bombing 1/10 and 10/10 seems to always come from the fandoms of whatever the adaptation is. I love One Piece the journey has taken me on over the last few years. That being said I had I went into this having low expectations but my hopes were high for it to succeed. Zoro is the best part of the anime as he is this adaptation. They took their liberties with the source material but overall it keeps the spirit of One Piece. So far I have found it enjoyable as I watch. As long I'm not nitpicking the changes apart and being over critical. As a stand alone series this is a solid series that most can find enjoyable.,01-Sep-23,6.0,review bombing seems always come fandoms whatever adaptation love one piece journey taken last years said went low expectations hopes high succeed zoro best part anime adaptation took liberties source material overall keeps spirit one piece far found enjoyable watch long im nitpicking changes apart critical stand alone series solid series find enjoyable
An explosion of utter joy and fun!,"I loved this-and I am over 70 and never heard of it before.

I love fantasy and sci-fi -so watch a lot of such content.

I knew there was a comic phenomenon in Japan called Manga- but had no idea there was a live film version.

I had thought it may be a bit like Pirates of the Caribbean - which was wonderfully carried by Johnny Depp.

I thought this would be the same- perhaps with a couple of stand out performances.

Wrong- the characters are all played as stand out performances.

From the very first scenes I was hooked- and binge watched the whole thing at one sitting.

It made me laugh, shed a little tear at times- and delighted in the relationships that were forming.

I really look forward to the next series.

I am also wondering if anyone has invented a snail-phone yet.

It's a rollicking piece of fun- enjoy.",22-Sep-23,10.0,loved thisand never heard love fantasy scifi watch lot content knew comic phenomenon japan called manga idea live film version thought may bit like pirates caribbean wonderfully carried johnny depp thought would perhaps couple stand performances wrong characters played stand performances first scenes hooked binge watched whole thing one sitting made laugh shed little tear times delighted relationships forming really look forward next series also wondering anyone invented snailphone yet rollicking piece fun enjoy
It's good and visually pleasing but the story ...,"I love how the series make it more real n more believable. The visual is sooo beautiful. The same as the manga. Hat off for the visual team! However, when it comes to the story, am a bit disappointed. The series only have 8 episodes but they manage to make it feel so slow. The fight scene is kinda boring. The buggy scene.. the syrup village scene, everything is done in a house, or a room, not in the village. Like hide and seek scene. I mean, it's still possible to make the fight scene better especially because in the manga, mostly filled with fight scene.

I just feel a BIG part of 'one piece' is missing. I wont say it's bad. It's okey. I can still watch it but it makes me sleepy watching it because how boring the dragging can be. Oh well. It's not the worst and i love how everything looks. And i also like the fact that all characters change clothes.. because we do change clothes in real life.

The characters, especially Zoro.. i just dont feel like it's Zoro. He is too one dimentional. Well, i am a big fan of Zoro in the manga!! So much!! Sadly i dont feel like watching him here..

Nami is soo robotic. So flat.. And Where is Genzo story?? Now Nami's tatto doesnt mean anything. Ppft. I understand it doesn't have to be exactly the same but why change the storyline that has meaning to the main story?? I dont hate it. I dont love it. Am neutral. Just dont feel like watching one piece.

For the people who thinks, it doesnt have to be the same, blablabla. Yes it doesn't. I agree. However, many story get cut from the manga to fit with the live action's timeline and i don't really get bothered by it. But removing fight scenes? Important small details like genzo's story? That's a lot. Plus, my husband is not even watching the anime nor reading the manga, and he feels bored most of the time.

PS : am a manga reader. I watched the anime but not all eps bcs the phasing is way slower than the manga so i compare the live action to the manga a.k.a the OG. And now i just want to read it all over again from chapter 1 bcs it's just that good.",31-Aug-23,6.0,love series make real n believable visual sooo beautiful manga hat visual team however comes story bit disappointed series episodes manage make feel slow fight scene kinda boring buggy scene syrup village scene everything done house room village like hide seek scene mean still possible make fight scene better especially manga mostly filled fight scene feel big part one piece missing wont say bad okey still watch makes sleepy watching boring dragging oh well worst love everything looks also like fact characters change clothes change clothes real life characters especially zoro dont feel like zoro one dimentional well big fan zoro manga much sadly dont feel like watching nami soo robotic flat genzo story namis tatto doesnt mean anything ppft understand doesnt exactly change storyline meaning main story dont hate dont love neutral dont feel like watching one piece people thinks doesnt blablabla yes doesnt agree however many story get cut manga fit live actions timeline dont really get bothered removing fight scenes important small details like genzos story thats lot plus husband even watching anime reading manga feels bored time ps manga reader watched anime eps bcs phasing way slower manga compare live action manga aka og want read chapter bcs good
"Undeniably One Piece, but Poorly Told","I feel like I'm going to get a lot of hate for this, but it also needs to be said. There is almost nothing redeeming about this show. Nearly every single aspect of it is subpar.

I have never watched a live adaptation of an anime, so it makes me question just how incredibly awful other live adaptations must be for this to be considered a good one by so many.

I'm not saying that there's no passion or effort behind this show, but it really doesn't show. All of the fun, energy, and thoughtfulness present in the anime's visuals and Japanese voice acting is just no where to be found here. The visuals are cheap and amateurish, while the acting is stale and unconvincing.

Animation and live action are two equally great but very different mediums. They are both visual and auditory experiences, but the way to make each convincing is not the same process. Bridging the gap is no easy task, so I respect the attempt, but in the end, this show just doesn't work.",01-Sep-23,5.0,feel like im going get lot hate also needs said almost nothing redeeming show nearly every single aspect subpar never watched live adaptation anime makes question incredibly awful live adaptations must considered good one many im saying theres passion effort behind show really doesnt show fun energy thoughtfulness present animes visuals japanese voice acting found visuals cheap amateurish acting stale unconvincing animation live action two equally great different mediums visual auditory experiences way make convincing process bridging gap easy task respect attempt end show doesnt work
Way better than I expected,"I've seen several of Netflix's attempts at live action anime and have not been pleased with any of them. Bleach, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, Rurouni Kenshin - I'm a fan of some of those anime, but did not like the live action. So when a friend told me this one was good, I kind of blew him off. He was right. This one's good.

To be fair, they're covering the easiest parts of the anime story at the moment, the character origin stories and how they put the crew together. Most of the core crew is represented, though not Chopper or the mechanical guy or Nico Robin. At least not yet.

All the origins align pretty closely with the anime...which is unsurprising. Netflix's adaptations have generally been very faithful. There are exceptions, but their attitude seems to be that they understand that these things have very OCD fan bases that will likely be pissed off by too much creative license being taken.

The effects do reasonable credit to the zanyness of the action. The actors are at least in the ballpark of representing who their characters are. I would say that I think some of the acting is a little sedate, but that might just be that it's hard to match the energy of the cartoon with the voice actors. But the actor doing Luffy captures his manic and insane optimism well. I was initially a little put off by the accent, but once I got used to it, the quality of the performance made me stop noticing.

One thing I don't like is something Netflix seems to do on all of these shows. I lack the vocabulary in cinematography to express it, but there's a certain...dreamlike quality to these things that I don't like. I don't know how to articulate it, but if you watch a couple of them, I think you'll know what I mean. Whatever it is - I hate that. It's distracting. It makes every scene feel like a dream or a flashback.

But yeah...overall this was a solid show. I'm not saying it was amazing, but neither was the source material. This captures the best of the source material and I was thoroughly entertained. I just wish more of these Netflix adaptations were that way.",09-Sep-23,7.0,ive seen several netflixs attempts live action anime pleased bleach death note cowboy bebop rurouni kenshin im fan anime like live action friend told one good kind blew right ones good fair theyre covering easiest parts anime story moment character origin stories put crew together core crew represented though chopper mechanical guy nico robin least yet origins align pretty closely animewhich unsurprising netflixs adaptations generally faithful exceptions attitude seems understand things ocd fan bases likely pissed much creative license taken effects reasonable credit zanyness action actors least ballpark representing characters would say think acting little sedate might hard match energy cartoon voice actors actor luffy captures manic insane optimism well initially little put accent got used quality performance made stop noticing one thing dont like something netflix seems shows lack vocabulary cinematography express theres certaindreamlike quality things dont like dont know articulate watch couple think youll know mean whatever hate distracting makes every scene feel like dream flashback yeahoverall solid show im saying amazing neither source material captures best source material thoroughly entertained wish netflix adaptations way
Now I want to watch the Anime.,"I've tried to watch One Piece, the anime, once or twice, but somehow it did not pick up. Maybe the characters were too weird, and it all seemed somehow silly so I never watched more than the first three episodes. And since most real life adaptations of anime are horrible, I was more than skeptical about this one. However, since I follow critics on YouTube like the Critical Drinker, Chris Gore, Nerdrotic etc. And they repeatedly said that this adaptation is everything it should be, I gave it a try and boy am I glad I did. This is, by far, one of the best productions I have seen in years! There is so much love and detail and so little w0ke politics in there. So what that the main character is now blackish/Hispanic? It really does not destroy the story in the slightest, as opposed to most of the recent race-swaps on Netflix. Plus he's supposed to be Brazilian.

I enjoyed this series so much that it almost pains me that the first season is over and I'm usually quite nonsensitive when it comes to movies and series, especially lately because there is literally nothing new to watch that is actually good. Well, One Piece is more than good, it is great and I hope that Eiichiro Oda stays the production's advisor and keeps his veto and the power to rewrite the script, because this man knows how to write.

Now I really want to know how the story continues and will probably watch the anime.",26-Sep-23,9.0,ive tried watch one piece anime twice somehow pick maybe characters weird seemed somehow silly never watched first three episodes since real life adaptations anime horrible skeptical one however since follow critics youtube like critical drinker chris gore nerdrotic etc repeatedly said adaptation everything gave try boy glad far one best productions seen years much love detail little wke politics main character blackishhispanic really destroy story slightest opposed recent raceswaps netflix plus hes supposed brazilian enjoyed series much almost pains first season im usually quite nonsensitive comes movies series especially lately literally nothing new watch actually good well one piece good great hope eiichiro oda stays productions advisor keeps veto power rewrite script man knows write really want know story continues probably watch anime
A different kind of pirate,"Based on the best selling manga series of all time, One Piece is a fun-filled adventure featuring a young man who dreams of becoming the king of the pirates.

Upon the execution of Gold Roger, the king of the pirates, treasure hunters all over the land start searching for his fabled treasure, the One Piece. Among those who dream of finding the treasure is Monkey D. Luffy (I√±aki Godoy), an orphan who does not get along with his grandfather, preferring to hang out with kind-hearted Red-Haired Shanks (Peter Gadiot), the head of the Red-Haired Pirates.

One time, Luffy finds a mysterious fruit among Shanks' loot and eats it. It turned his body into rubber, that is, stretchable. When Shanks finally decides to leave East Blue, he ignores Luffy's pleas to make him part of the crew, deeming him too young, and instead leaves the boy his straw hat.

The day arrives when Luffy sets out to be a pirate. The rest of Season 1 is a delightful adventure detailing how he finds the crew of his Straw Hats Pirates as well as the map to the Grand Line where One Piece is allegedly located, with the marines and other pirate crews hot on their trail.

This is well-made and highly entertaining, though somewhat violent. What I like most about it is that Luffy's crew have great fighting skills but are noble-hearted. It discourages stereotyping. It shows that not all pirates are bad and not all marines are good. And so far, all Straw Hats pirates are inherently kind-hearted who are in it for the adventure and freedom.",06-Sep-23,9.0,based best selling manga series time one piece funfilled adventure featuring young man dreams becoming king pirates upon execution gold roger king pirates treasure hunters land start searching fabled treasure one piece among dream finding treasure monkey luffy iaki godoy orphan get along grandfather preferring hang kindhearted redhaired shanks peter gadiot head redhaired pirates one time luffy finds mysterious fruit among shanks loot eats turned body rubber stretchable shanks finally decides leave east blue ignores luffys pleas make part crew deeming young instead leaves boy straw hat day arrives luffy sets pirate rest season delightful adventure detailing finds crew straw hats pirates well map grand line one piece allegedly located marines pirate crews hot trail wellmade highly entertaining though somewhat violent like luffys crew great fighting skills noblehearted discourages stereotyping shows pirates bad marines good far straw hats pirates inherently kindhearted adventure freedom

"One of the best live action, but still a live action","I would recommend if you like the show, but I'd set expectations that it's not better.

I loved the cast. Everyone seems to be perfect for their role. The guy playing Luffy has done a great job imo. The Zoro guy, has gotten the character's vibe just right.

It is unavoidable to compare with the anime and the live action is limited, and it shows. Especially the fight scenes. It's clear that some of the fighting scenes are a bit forced and the result is not great.

Pretty good CGI with little exceptions where there is a visible fake scene, even for my untrained eyes.

There are some cringe moments when it's attempted to recreate some anime moments and emotions.

Very promising overall and enjoyed watching it. Unfortunately, the comparison with the anime cannot be avoided and it loses by miles. You can do things with drawn images that you cannot replicate in live action.

I would still watch more seasons but I'd like to move a bit farther from some anime techniques as they translate poorly on camera.",09-Sep-23,7.0,would recommend like show id set expectations better loved cast everyone seems perfect role guy playing luffy done great job imo zoro guy gotten characters vibe right unavoidable compare anime live action limited shows especially fight scenes clear fighting scenes bit forced result great pretty good cgi little exceptions visible fake scene even untrained eyes cringe moments attempted recreate anime moments emotions promising overall enjoyed watching unfortunately comparison anime cannot avoided loses miles things drawn images cannot replicate live action would still watch seasons id like move bit farther anime techniques translate poorly camera
For a live adaptation great work but it isn't for me,"The live adaptation is a breath of fresh air for old one piece fans and great to start for new one piece fans.

But this show just isn't for me,I like one piece for the humour,the fight scenes,the plot and the emotional pick me up scenes.

This has only the plot with many characters cut out which is fine I guess but they forgot the humour and pivotal fight scenes .. For example luffy fight with arlong needs to be a bit longer,luffy fight with don Krieg should have been present since it shows luffy's guts and is one of the main reasons why sanji believes in luffy's strength.just a few examples

I don't mind more of this since I am a big fan of one piece but cutting out character arcs about why the main characters are the way they are will bite the showrunners in the long run.

Anyway decent binge watch but not for me.",03-Sep-23,6.0,live adaptation breath fresh air old one piece fans great start new one piece fans show isnt mei like one piece humourthe fight scenesthe plot emotional pick scenes plot many characters cut fine guess forgot humour pivotal fight scenes example luffy fight arlong needs bit longerluffy fight krieg present since shows luffys guts one main reasons sanji believes luffys strengthjust examples dont mind since big fan one piece cutting character arcs main characters way bite showrunners long run anyway decent binge watch
Impressive adaptation,"When i heard a live action version of One Piece was in the offing, I couldn't imagine how they would adapt this acid trip of a show to live actors.

Well, after watching all of season one, I'm impressed. They dropped most of the insanity and actually managed to convert it into a decent bit of cinema. The mild plot rewrites produced a mature and cohesive show with legs, without sacrificing it's core.

I√±aki Godoy as Luffy was as perfect a casting as I have ever seen. He fully embodied this slightly more sane Luffy and the skills he demonstrated in ""The Imperfects"" were a mere foreshadowing of what he is capable of. He carries this show quite ably without diminishing his co-stars.

Well done, I can hardly wait for the next season.",03-Oct-23,10.0,heard live action version one piece offing couldnt imagine would adapt acid trip show live actors well watching season one im impressed dropped insanity actually managed convert decent bit cinema mild plot rewrites produced mature cohesive show legs without sacrificing core iaki godoy luffy perfect casting ever seen fully embodied slightly sane luffy skills demonstrated imperfects mere foreshadowing capable carries show quite ably without diminishing costars well done hardly wait next season
Power rangers of the caribbean - A show made for kids,"I'm not saying that this show is bad what-so-ever. Though I felt it from the very first episode, after watching 3 episodes, I came to the conclusion that this show is not for adults. I know this is a live adaption of everlasting manga anime, One Piece, but I noticed that the set, costumes, acting(not, actors), fights, and CGI are definitely aimed at younger, much younger audience. It's not for picky adults. If you are not convinced, compare this show with Pirates of Caribbeans 1, 2 and 3. I'm talking about the overall quality. For me, a live adaptation of Cowboy Bebop is miles better than this show. This comes from a big fan of Cowboy Bebop anime. Again, this isn't a bad show.

"It's not an original anime, but...","I'm not going to write a review, nor comment on is it better or worse then the original, although my rating speaks enough about how i feel about this series.

Few things however are worth mentioning.

Cast - Just brilliant. The energy of each character is so well portraited, that I can't single out anyone.

Attention to detail - I had to watch the show several times to notice all the details the crew brilliantly incorporated into the series.

Music - It feels like watching a Movie! Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli did an amazing job. I especially liked how they incorporated an original series theme to the finale of Season 1.

Loved it,"Netflix's adaptation of ""One Piece"" is a delightful journey for both long-time fans and newcomers. The characters are faithfully brought to life, capturing the essence of Eiichiro Oda's world. The cast's excellent performances breathe life into the iconic Straw Hat Pirates, making them truly endearing.

Now, let's address the CGI, which in my opinion, was surprisingly fantastic. It seamlessly blends with traditional animation, enhancing epic battles and the fantastical elements of the series. The attention to detail in the CGI is commendable, and it adds a unique visual flair that truly sets this adaptation apart.

Frankly, I'm baffled by the complaints about the CGI. It not only meets but often exceeds expectations

In conclusion, ""One Piece"" on Netflix is a treasure worth discovering. Join Luffy and his crew on this grand adventure, and you'll be hooked from the first episode.

"For an anime live action, it's above standards","I loved this series, it was very well made and had so much potential. But at some aspects it just lacks character, and most of all, humour. One piece is one of the funniest animes I've seen, and that makes it so unique, and this remake was just dead serious. Even luffy is very serious most of the time, he could have been portraited a lot better to give the show more heart. Apart from that, the cinematography is crafted well and fitted the story. They left the right part of the original story out to eliminate the annoying parts, without losing the important narrative.

One Giant Piece Of TRASH,"I wanted this to be more like Kung Fu Hustle or Hook, but it really didn't feel like the director had a clear vision for the final product. It feels more like a broadway play, with poor direction, cheesy dialogue and over-acting. Like many other manga to live action attempts, it really misses the mark and is riddled with plot holes as they desperately try to squeeze five episodes into one and take zero chances at veering away from the anime in fear of upsetting the fans. The cheesy music and dialogue mixed with violence was confusing, I couldn't tell if this was meant for adults or kids? If something is going to to be sooo unbearably tacky, they should have picked a lane and really ramped up the violence or put more effort into the script. Really stupid and definitely DOES NOT BREAK THE CURSE of all anime live actions being terrible.

LIVE ACTION JUSTICE!!!!!!!!,"Finally, justice has been done!

You've probably been in the same boat as me during all these years, in which every time you watched a live action movie/series, you just felt disappointed because there were just too different or poor in comparison to the original anime/manga.

Nonetheless, this will not happen to you One Piece.

It is crystal clear that not only lots of money was invested on this show but also LOVE; lots of love from the staff!

The acting is awesome, the cosplays too! It doesn't feel cringy at all and as you know, this seems quite impossible making a live action series of a SHOUNEN ANIME which just has ""ridiculous things"" going on.

My main worry was Luffy's power. I mean, a real human being just stretching felt so...weird!

YET, THIS WAS NOT THE CASE!! Luffy's actor is perfect, and the stretching makes him even cooler!

Last but not least, there are ""extra scenes"" which are Easter Eggs for the true fans and also some little changes that make everything be understood better for newcomers or just suit the story better.

It can easily be seen that Eiichiro Oda supervised this series because none of it feel as a ""filler"" or ""clich√© hollywood-like"".

"""Take the original and make it your own"" done right!","I had my own angst when I heard about a live action One Piece series, in English(!!!!). I have the anime on a superhigh pedestal. Anime is my savior as an 80's kid, and One Piece sits on my personal divided top spot together with Steins Gate and Initial D. Also as anime goes, One Piece has some of the most radocal character designs and abilities ever, so can a good, Western built live action adaptation be made? Well, after binging the series, I am glad to say it can be done and HAS been done. Everyone could see the setpieces are awesome, but the actors playing each and every big or little role to how the characters are in the original to a tee! And seemingly having of fun doing it :D And although the story from time to time deviates from what happend originally, it is in my opinion the perfect version of ""Take the original and make it your own"". Most of what happens and is important in the original happens here too and is done awesomely, while the different stuff is handled with grace and in the same atmosphere as the original. As for subs and dubs, the cast are doing such a great work, that I rather watch this in English than ""dubbing"" it in Japanese, even though I never, EVER will watch a anime dub.

Most importantly, it is dumb to compare this one on one with the anime it came from. Enjoy the odes to the original work and for the rest experience One Piece in a totally new way. This way, I guarantee you will love this series as much as I do ;)

I felt a little kid again after watching this show,"I have to say that i know very few things about this universe because i have not read any of the manga and from the anime i watched only a couple of episodes as a little kid in the early 2000s but never bothered to watch it as i grown up. Many of my friends are big fans of the anime but they all started it years ago when it was very easy with very few episodes to pick it up. I have to say that after watching the live-action adaptation of Netflix i enjoyed it so much that i started the anime too. I felt a little kid again in a very nostalgic and positive way that i can't explain. (I am 29 years old) The first positive i have to say for this show is that all the actors that worked on it and most of them are not well known did such a wonderful job. Especially Buggy the Clown character, Luffy, Shanks, Mihawk, Sanji, Zef and Garp were outstanding. They seem so invested and passionate about this show and their characters while giving such good performances. The second positive is the lore and world building. They did a great job introducing all these things to newcomers like me. The third positive is the music. Each different song matches very well the theme of the Pirates and the Marines. And the icing on the cake is the action scenes and the blend of practical effects and cgi.

I have nothing major negative to say about this show except that in some dramatic scenes they overdid it a bit with the cheesy lines that kinda ruined the momentum. But overall the comedy was very spot on in almost all scenes. The show has also good messages to teach to all ages of people to always chase your dreams, never give up, be good and kind to others and protect your closest friends and families. And never afraid to defend yourself when you know you are right.

Highly recommend it, one of the best pleasant surprises i had for this year.

There is so so many problems, and lousy shortcuts.

Some of the iconic fight of season 1 do not even exist.

The fight with the man in golden armor on baratie : gone mihawk kill him in less 30 seconds. What the hell ??

What is that ? What everyone is giving this awful trash a 10/10 are you people going nuts ?

This is an insult to the anime on so so many points i do not know how to start. Everything is smoothed, flat, you can't feel anything when you watching this, it is a giant cosplay.

I am sure it is the best live action ever made ""well"" no thanks !

The acting is correct at best if you like soap opera flat as Mediterranean see.

To be simple, the remove everything was complicated to do visually.

All the characters are so small and tiny.

For example arlong is a dwarf, so tiny so small !!!

Even garp is just not big enough.

This production deserve at best some of the Lord of the ring special effects for character design but no they just used cosplay that's is so so ridiculous.

What a ridiculous overrated TRASH !

This is a dragon ball evolution with more budget that's all at the end same results, a very awful tv adaptation.

The worst moment for me was the nami scene when she yelling ""Arlong! Arlong!"" Cutting out the tattoo, it is so so flat, each time i re watch this scene on the anime i almost cry, it is one of the most powerful moment of the anime at my eyes, but in this tv trash it is just so bad and scene more luffy than nami.

I almost feel like throwing up, if you like and respect the original anime, RUN AWAY!",02-Sep-23,2.0,episode want puke pathetic bad cosplay original characters ridiculous fight scene horrible musics even replaced bad ambiance awful songs many problems lousy shortcuts iconic fight season even exist captain kuro fight scene beach gone garp scottish fight man golden armor baratie gone mihawk kill less seconds hell everyone giving awful trash people going nuts insult anime many points know start everything smoothed flat cant feel anything watching giant cosplay sure best live action ever made well thanks acting correct best like soap opera flat mediterranean see simple remove everything complicated visually characters small tiny example arlong dwarf tiny small even garp big enough production deserve best lord ring special effects character design used cosplay thats ridiculous ridiculous overrated trash dragon ball evolution budget thats end results awful tv adaptation worst moment nami scene yelling arlong arlong cutting tattoo flat time watch scene anime almost cry one powerful moment anime eyes tv trash bad scene luffy nami almost feel like throwing like respect original anime run away
Not that bad but could have been better,"Fan since more than 20years, i was looking forward to see this live action. As most of the show is pretty nice and deliver some good feelings, there are some thing that don't make it perfect for me
first the fights are really poorly made, i didn't felt any thrive or passion, they are lacking intensity, lenght and sp√©cials effects. And luffy attacks don't do any justice to the manga or the anime. Exemple, the only gateling had only one angle and lasted bearly a second...to expensive ? Any how it kills a big part of One Piece so√ªl for me.



Sanji and his famous eyesbra, and let's say it wasn't si hard to do, doesn't exist. And where is the cigaret ? I can understand about the nose of Ussop but on this one...
most of Luffy's screaming with his arms up are really ridiculous. To bad...
The look of Shanks with the sea creature √† BIG fail...
Looks like they made bad choices between what to keep that makes manga/anim√© signature and the live action/reality part.

I still hope to see an other season. But I don't think that Netflix will ever take this Masterpiece to the end.

only from a visual standpoint not as bad as i expected but still 5/10,"I expected the adaptation to look quite horrible from the trailers and netflix's history and etc and it's surprisingly better MUCH better then i expected not great or good BY ANY MEANS not at all 5/10 might even be a bit too high (at least from episode 1... just take a look at the animals wtf is that even 20 year old cgi)

but yeah no where nearly as ""plasticy"" as you'd think the world looks lived in the effects such as blood are reasonable idk about the casting.acting but could've been better

"It's a decent show, but very overrated in my opinion","I haven't watched the anime. My review is based on its entertainment value for a general adult audience rather than its faithfulness to the source material for fans.

Luffy is a character I am having very hard time to connect with. He's one of the most annoying main characters I've seen in a while. I can understand being naive or stupid, but his level is delusion is just irritating. He's an adult who's been on his own for quite some time; It's hard to believe he he doesn't understand he can't pay for food by merely saying ""I'll be rich one day and then I'll pay"". It's ridiculous. Furthermore the amount of times he repeats ""I'm Gonna Be King Of The Pirates"" becomes tiresome.

The show is rated PG-14, which means it's not meant for children. Yet, when we see a character on the brink of death due to blood loss, we don't see any blood. The only instance of Zoro cutting someone with his sword is in the first episode. They also never kill anyone, they are just knocking off the pirates and leaving, allowing those pirates to come back after them or the people they saved.

Idiotic and senseless scenarios like these just keep repeating.

Perhaps it's intended to be humorous for younger viewers, but considering the show's non-kid-friendly rating, I just don't get it.

It's unique, the production is awesome, but it's just not intriguing as the average rating here suggests.",06-Sep-23,6.0,havent watched anime review based entertainment value general adult audience rather faithfulness source material fans luffy character hard time connect hes one annoying main characters ive seen understand naive stupid level delusion irritating hes adult whos quite time hard believe doesnt understand cant pay food merely saying ill rich one day ill pay ridiculous furthermore amount times repeats im gonna king pirates becomes tiresome show rated pg means meant children yet see character brink death due blood loss dont see blood instance zoro cutting someone sword first episode also never kill anyone knocking pirates leaving allowing pirates come back people saved idiotic senseless scenarios like keep repeating perhaps intended humorous younger viewers considering shows nonkidfriendly rating dont get unique production awesome intriguing average rating suggests
I'm Shocked On How That Was Good!,"This series is simply breathtaking the rhythm is incredible, the development of the characters too, the special effects are very successful, it's the best series to my taste on the Netflix platform for the flaws they are minor: - the ussop fight is too short but also I would have liked to see a zoro vs kabaji - and some flashback scene was also a little short (the one where luffy cries in front of shanks and that of nami in front of a mother-in-law) but otherwise it's incredible it's the best series in real shooting of an anime and by far I ask for a season 2 clearly

What is this? And why do I like it?,"I have no idea what I'm watching, I see people talking about anime, which I know nothing about. All I know is that I'm really enjoying this show. The protagonist is so optimistic and so eager to achieve his dream that makes me smile. In this world full of pouty young people complaining of how hard they have it, he's a breath of fresh air. Also, his desire to help others achieving their dreams is such a good example. I would advise older adults to check it out. If a 73 years old grandmother likes it, it got to be good!

A great adaptation of a beloved franchise,"I have never watched or read one piece, so I didn't have any expectations going in, but I must admit I enjoyed the journey and story a lot. The 1000+ episodes of the anime is a bit too daunting for me, so I'll be following this live action adaptation instead as it's a great entry point into the world of pirates.

The characters are distinct and unique, and every single crew member contribute with their own twist and quirk. The production quality is amazing, which helps with building a believable world and making the special attacks seem more realistic and not as cartoony and animated.

We learn about each of their struggles and backgrounds, giving a better understanding of their character and motivations, which in the end lead to a great conclusion to this part of the story, as there is so much more to discover and explore. I can't wait for season 2 and will surely be watching along.",18-Sep-23,8.0,never watched read one piece didnt expectations going must admit enjoyed journey story lot episodes anime bit daunting ill following live action adaptation instead great entry point world pirates characters distinct unique every single crew member contribute twist quirk production quality amazing helps building believable world making special attacks seem realistic cartoony animated learn struggles backgrounds giving better understanding character motivations end lead great conclusion part story much discover explore cant wait season surely watching along
"An oasis in the desert, a breath of fresh air","I have pretty much turned my back on the current entertainment industry only watching good pre-ideological takeover material and thankfully there is decades' worth of it, enough to outlast this storm of low quality. In this period of mediocrity ""One Piece"" is a hopeful bright ray of sunlight shinning through the darkness, a much needed oasis in the desert, a surprisingly good production, a fantasy adventure in a world full of quests, hidden treasures, pirates, heroes, villains and monsters that has similarities to 16th century Europe, the show is full of hapiness, hope, humor and courage in a world were the good guys are not always good and the bad guys are not always bad, Monkey D. Luffy is an outlaw pirate that helps people and does good by his friends.

The acting is spot on, the casting is spot on, and the over the top colourful cinematography is very suitable for a manga adaptation, apparently all thanks to franchise creator Eiichiro Oda who kept creative control and forced !! Netflix to reshoot certain scenes because they weren't good enough. And the result shows. Simply amazing, can't wait for more seasons.",16-Sep-23,10.0,pretty much turned back current entertainment industry watching good preideological takeover material thankfully decades worth enough outlast storm low quality period mediocrity one piece hopeful bright ray sunlight shinning darkness much needed oasis desert surprisingly good production fantasy adventure world full quests hidden treasures pirates heroes villains monsters similarities th century europe show full hapiness hope humor courage world good guys always good bad guys always bad monkey luffy outlaw pirate helps people good friends acting spot casting spot top colourful cinematography suitable manga adaptation apparently thanks franchise creator eiichiro oda kept creative control forced netflix reshoot certain scenes werent good enough result shows simply amazing cant wait seasons

It was accurate but in better way .. episodes 2/3 were amazing I liked the action and Zoro andI loved kaya and how her palace was designed and for ussop i Personally wish he wore glasses so it. Be more accurate to the original anime.

Later episodes were just as good only that they keep getting better and better . I never thought I'd like Sanji but I did lol . And in the end they show nami .

Surprisingly Good,"The whole thesis of the show is around family (queue the Dom meme) which made it a feel-good season. The origin flashback scenes are well inserted as their timings were perfect and well connected to the present-day plot. They all seem to have some deep routed trauma which jump started each characters pirate journey so it tries to play on the emotions. The formula of the show is very simple. It's a journey, each episode is a new stop, new characters, new location, new drama, by end of the episode justice is served then onto the next stop. I like it simple. Compared to the anime they managed to fit around 4 seasons of anime into 1 season of live action. Which is proof there are way too many fillers in the anime. A story that gets straight to the point is what we have here and it works. It's an action-packed finale and a wholesome ending that comes full circle, it's worth going through it all before judging.",01-Sep-23,7.0,whole thesis show around family queue dom meme made feelgood season origin flashback scenes well inserted timings perfect well connected presentday plot seem deep routed trauma jump started characters pirate journey tries play emotions formula show simple journey episode new stop new characters new location new drama end episode justice served onto next stop like simple compared anime managed fit around seasons anime season live action proof way many fillers anime story gets straight point works actionpacked finale wholesome ending comes full circle worth going judging
Enjoyed by somebody who has never watched the anime,"I have never touched One Piece in my life, so I wasn't sure if the live action was going to be for me. I sat down with my brother who has watched one piece and me and him both enjoyed this live action. I reckon that this is a series that could both be enjoyed by one piece fans and by people who have never seen the anime before. You can tell this series has had a somewhat decent budget put into it and the actors somewhat resemble the characters in the anime. The CGI is decent but the cinematography is really nice, the background sets look realistic and makes you feel like you are in the one piece universe.

To summarise: I have never watched one piece before, but I really enjoyed this live action. I recommend for both one piece enjoyed and people who haven't watched the anime.",12-Sep-23,9.0,never touched one piece life wasnt sure live action going sat brother watched one piece enjoyed live action reckon series could enjoyed one piece fans people never seen anime tell series somewhat decent budget put actors somewhat resemble characters anime cgi decent cinematography really nice background sets look realistic makes feel like one piece universe summarise never watched one piece really enjoyed live action recommend one piece enjoyed people havent watched anime
Keep it going we need a Season 2,"I've followed OP since it came to the states in Monthly shounen jump in the early 2000s, then I began the anime in 2004 when it got its first dub. I've been a lifelong fan of this series and wanted nothing more than this series to be good, however there are VERY Few live action anime adaptations that work. So my hopes were hi but expectations low.

I am so happy to say that this was an amazing success have tiny little nitpicks here and there but they are nothing in comparison to everything that was done right in this and I'm so happy for the OP community, Eichiro Oda, everyone involved, and the new fans who will be introduced to this incredible story in this new medium.

Such a fun, campy, love-filled ride of adventure. We need to see loguetown and dressrosa in a second season.

I absolutely loved this and am so happy it is getting the recognition and views it deserves.

Anime Live action curse broken !!? THIS IS AMAZING!!,"As a non-anime watcher, I embarked on a journey to explore this highly anticipated series and found myself utterly captivated by its well-casted characters, immersive storytelling, outstanding VFX, and an experience that shattered the curse of live-action anime adaptations. Binge-watching all the episodes in a single day was a testament to the series' gripping narrative and stellar execution.

The casting choices for ""One Piece"" on Netflix deserve immense praise. From Monkey D. Luffy to Roronoa Zoro, and the rest of the Straw Hat Pirates, each character felt true to their anime counterparts, both in terms of appearance and personality. Fans of the original series can rest assured that the live-action adaptation pays a respectful homage to Eiichiro Oda's iconic characters. The standout performance has to be from the charismatic and goofy Monkey D. Luffy, portrayed by a talented actor who seamlessly captures Luffy's adventurous spirit and determination. The chemistry between the main cast members is palpable, making it easy to root for this motley crew on their epic journey.

One of the remarkable aspects of the Netflix ""One Piece"" series is its ability to draw in viewers who may not typically be fans of anime. As a newcomer to the genre, I found the story incredibly engaging and accessible. The show takes the time to introduce the world of the Grand Line, the concept of Devil Fruits, and the various pirate crews, allowing newcomers to understand and appreciate the rich lore of the ""One Piece"" universe. It is a testament to the writing and direction that the series can cater to both die-hard fans and newcomers alike, striking a perfect balance between fan service and accessibility.

The visual effects in the ""One Piece"" series are nothing short of impressive. Bringing the fantastical elements of the anime to life is no small feat, but the series rises to the occasion with top-notch CGI and practical effects. The vibrant and diverse world of ""One Piece"" is rendered in stunning detail, from the lush greenery of the jungle-filled islands to the towering warships and colossal sea creatures. The action sequences are a visual spectacle, with Luffy's Gum-Gum abilities and Zoro's swordsmanship being particularly well-executed. The VFX team has done a commendable job in staying true to the source material while adapting it for live-action, resulting in an immersive experience that does justice to the anime's legacy.

One of the most significant achievements of the Netflix ""One Piece"" series is its potential to break the curse that has plagued live-action anime adaptations in the past. Historically, fans of anime have often been disappointed by subpar live-action versions of their favorite shows and movies. However, ""One Piece"" stands as a shining example of how meticulous casting, faithful adaptation, and high-quality production values can defy expectations. This series should serve as a turning point for Netflix, encouraging them to explore more live-action adaptations of popular anime properties. It not only respects the source material but elevates it to a new level of entertainment.

Binge-watching all the episodes in a single day is a testament to the series' addictive storytelling. The pacing is well-balanced, with each episode leaving viewers hungry for the next installment. The character development is another highlight, as we witness the growth and evolution of the Straw Hat Pirates as they encounter formidable adversaries and face their inner demons. The series is not just about epic battles and treasure hunting; it also explores themes of friendship, loyalty, and the pursuit of dreams. These universal themes resonate with audiences of all ages and backgrounds, making ""One Piece"" a truly timeless tale.

In conclusion, Netflix's live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" is a resounding success. It has managed to capture the essence of the beloved anime and manga series while simultaneously breaking the curse of lackluster live-action anime adaptations. The well-casted characters, outstanding visual effects, and engaging storytelling make it a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike. This series should serve as a blueprint for future live-action anime projects, and I, for one, am excited to see what Netflix has in store for the world of anime adaptations. ""One Piece"" on Netflix has set a high bar, and I can't wait to embark on more adventures with the Straw Hat Pirates in the future.",27-Sep-23,9.0,nonanime watcher embarked journey explore highly anticipated series found utterly captivated wellcasted characters immersive storytelling outstanding vfx experience shattered curse liveaction anime adaptations bingewatching episodes single day testament series gripping narrative stellar execution casting choices one piece netflix deserve immense praise monkey luffy roronoa zoro rest straw hat pirates character felt true anime counterparts terms appearance personality fans original series rest assured liveaction adaptation pays respectful homage eiichiro odas iconic characters standout performance charismatic goofy monkey luffy portrayed talented actor seamlessly captures luffys adventurous spirit determination chemistry main cast members palpable making easy root motley crew epic journey one remarkable aspects netflix one piece series ability draw viewers may typically fans anime newcomer genre found story incredibly engaging accessible show takes time introduce world grand line concept devil fruits various pirate crews allowing newcomers understand appreciate rich lore one piece universe testament writing direction series cater diehard fans newcomers alike striking perfect balance fan service accessibility visual effects one piece series nothing short impressive bringing fantastical elements anime life small feat series rises occasion topnotch cgi practical effects vibrant diverse world one piece rendered stunning detail lush greenery junglefilled islands towering warships colossal sea creatures action sequences visual spectacle luffys gumgum abilities zoros swordsmanship particularly wellexecuted vfx team done commendable job staying true source material adapting liveaction resulting immersive experience justice animes legacy one significant achievements netflix one piece series potential break curse plagued liveaction anime adaptations past historically fans anime often disappointed subpar liveaction versions favorite shows movies however one piece stands shining example meticulous casting faithful adaptation highquality production values defy expectations series serve turning point netflix encouraging explore liveaction adaptations popular anime properties respects source material elevates new level entertainment bingewatching episodes single day testament series addictive storytelling pacing wellbalanced episode leaving viewers hungry next installment character development another highlight witness growth evolution straw hat pirates encounter formidable adversaries face inner demons series epic battles treasure hunting also explores themes friendship loyalty pursuit dreams universal themes resonate audiences ages backgrounds making one piece truly timeless tale conclusion netflixs liveaction adaptation one piece resounding success managed capture essence beloved anime manga series simultaneously breaking curse lackluster liveaction anime adaptations wellcasted characters outstanding visual effects engaging storytelling make mustwatch fans newcomers alike series serve blueprint future liveaction anime projects one excited see netflix store world anime adaptations one piece netflix set high bar cant wait embark adventures straw hat pirates future
Unbelievably Engaging,"I stumbled upon this show in Netflix's top 10 when looking for something light-hearted. I wanted to watch 1 or 2 episodes before moving on to something else. Instead, I was drawn in and binge-watched the whole series. A really well-made and entertaining series.

Most Fun I've Had On Netflix Since Stranger Things Season 1,"When I saw the trailer for this show it looked dumb as heck but the trailer failed to capture the heart and soul of this series that shines through almost immediately in episode 1.

There's a lot that goes into making a show like this work. Very few have cracked the code of how to translate Anime to live action and it's mostly because the people who make these adaptions only understand that they ARE popular but not why.

We love the characters, we love the action, we love the set pieces and costumes and boy does this show do all of that right.

Almost every character has a complicated backstory that is well fleshed out and makes sense.

Luffy is a ray of sunshine in this relatively dark and unforgiving world filled with ruthless pirates more interested in the dark side of piracy whereas Luffy understand that piracy isn't about the bad stuff, it's about freedom, loyalty, adventure and standing up for what's right.

I would definitely recommend this to pretty much anyone. The action is on point, the characters are used to their fullest extent and the story is expertly written and executed.

Very bad adaption. I can't understand the good rating,"Forget this one, just read the manga please if you want a emotionally heart warming and cool adventurous story. I dunno the perspective of those who doesn't read the manga but for me who not so religiously follow the manga (I take a break at Wan) arc and decided to read later), this is a very bad adaptation even an insult to the original. This series successfully make me write one of the longest IMDB reviews I've ever wrote. Why? Since I have sooooooooo many things to complained about. Okay here we go. I warned you, I spill, critique every single scene, and pointed out what was different from the original manga as far as I could remember (I even reread the original to refresh some scenes). I apologize beforehand for my messed up english, not my first language.

At first I was convinced this will be good after the trailer. My expectation very soon goes downhill through each episode. I watch until episode 5 and give up because it becomes unbearable for me to continue (my husband on the other hand, still trying to finish all the episode remaining). Everything feels so bad, there are only 2 things I thought were great : the setting and the buggy cast. Buggy scene is quite enjoyable to watch and the acting is also not bad. The Buggy scene is great though they altered some of it from manga but that's still okay. However, beside those 2 things, I found everything was so.....disappointing. They altered a lot from the manga especially since the Baratie story (the Usop story is not great either but still bearable eventhough they kill Merry who supposed to be survive in the manga). The characters are very deviate from the original. Garp is supposed to be this chill, cool, funny, wild grandpa but here they made him a very serious angry vice admiral who desperately want to capture luffy to the point calling Mihawk to chase after him (wtf). They get rid off Don Krieg completely from the Baratie arc. Mihawk who, in the middle of eliminating Don Krieg, got a call from Garp to captured Luffy. This is very different from the original. In the original, Mihawk was looking for Don Krieg and it leads him to Baratie, coincidentally meet Luffy who was forced working in the kitchen because the damaged he caused to Baratie. Mihawk doesn't have intention to fight Strawhats, let alone captured him for Garp. This is so weird. Nami is also out of character here. She is supposed to be taking advantage of Sanji when Sanji flirt with her to he give free of charge food. Here, she expressed disgust and awkward attitude towards Sanji when he is flirting with her. Nami is also supposed to be already sneaking out and leaving Baratie by stealing Going Merry from the crew when Don Krieg comes and making a mess at Baratie. Since in this period, Nami is supposed to be still prioritizing her safety and goals above the Strawhats. Here, instead of fleeing she stays with the crew to witness Mihawk defeat Zoro (Don Krieg doesn't appear at all at Baratie because he was defeated by Mihawk. I understand they might cut off Don Krieg fight with Luffy completely because of the difficulty in taking shot or production. Fighting scene above the water, stepping only on floating plank might challenging if not impossible to recreate in Live adaptation). They also reveal Garp is Luffy grandpa this early and give a lot of unnecessary portion of scene to Coby (who, in reality, only appears a very short time in the early time of Luffy adventure. So why they give a lot of scene to this Coby?). They also remove the iconic curly eyebrows of Sanji! They potrayed Sanji as someone who feels stucked in Baratie and how Zeff held back his potential (which is super untrue, we all know Sanji feels debted to Zeff and adamantly choose to stay at Baratie even at the cost of his dream). My conclusion so far up to episode 5, Luffy cast is the worst. Seriously, who cast him. He is not Luffy by all means. Luffy supposed to be this kind, innocent, simpleton guy who wants to be a pirate king. But here, he is super annoying. He smiles too often, his smile is creepy to look at, and he is an idiot beyond saving, far worse than Usop. Luffy is a man with a few words, but his words often can touch deep the hearts of others (he can be silly and idiotic but never feel annoying, just pure straightforward). He is supposed to be a charismatic character. This Luffy in the series failed to potray all that. I was really disgusted at Luffy, especially when Luffy got angry at Zeff and saying he is holding back Sanji (dude, this is very different from manga. Zeff is a fatherly figure for Sanji. Someone Sanji very admired and feel grateful for. Zeff knows Sanji dream and potential, he tried to make Sanji leave for his sake and Luffy NEVER GOT ANGRY AT ZEFF. In this series, I was so embarrassed an frustated when I see Luffy lashed out at Zeff saying he waste Sanji potential and its better for Sanji to come with him. In the manga, the reason Luffy want Sanji is because Luffy was looking for a cook and he likes Sanji personality and skill but Luffy never lashed out at Zeff or even blaming him for holding back Sanji. This is supposed to be one of heartwarming arc but instead of feeling emotionally moved, I feel enraged by how the series ruined the original characters. Luffy supposed to be the pivotal character, the anchor of all the crews but here... The cast for Luffy is so wrong. He speaks too much, his action and fighting scene is too simple and not cool (I know it might be too hard to exaclty replicate his fighting style but still..they make him TALKS TOO MUCH. IT IS NOT LUFFY AT ALL.) I understand if they try to cut some scenes or characters because the manga is a very long story with a lot of characters, but they take the wrong turns. They cut important scenes and adding not important scene like when Zeff do emergency surgery with Sanji help to stitch Zoro wound and patching him up with dead fishes (seriously, this is not in the manga and I dont understand why they add this unnecessary scene). There also no fishmen as Baratie staff in the manga. They mixed Baratie story with Arlong story. Arlong suddenly appear at Baratie (WTH. The Strawhats supposed to be go to Nami hometown, Cocoyashi Village, to chase after her and taking back going merry she stole from them. There they will learn Nami's background story and save her from Arlong clutched). So many things deviated from the original and in a bad way, they really change the story (and completely, some scenes) from episode 5 onward. I am speechless. What a let down and waste of the potential.

A fantastic adaptation,"This adaptation is just superb!

Goods:
The cast is probably the highlight (thanks to Oda sensei and the talent search crew for that). Nami is the BEST!



The core story is there. There are obviously some changes but they do not divert the story too much.



Beautiful cinematography



It kept the essence of heart-warming of the manga+anime.


Bads:
Some beloved side characters were not there



It felt a little rushed but overall, it is the best shonen adaptation by a million miles.


Final consensus: Can't wait to see Robin, Chopper, and the rest of the crew members. I NEED SEASON TWO LIKE RIGHT NOW!!!",02-Sep-23,9.0,adaptation superb goods cast probably highlight thanks oda sensei talent search crew nami best core story obviously changes divert story much beautiful cinematography kept essence heartwarming mangaanime bads beloved side characters felt little rushed overall best shonen adaptation million miles final consensus cant wait see robin chopper rest crew members need season two like right
1 episode in,"I absolutely loved the first episode, I'm caught up in the anime (not the manga, sorry folks) and this was a fantastic interpretation of one piece. I thought this would be like all the other live action anime adaptations, but I was wrong. It was energetic, well choreographed, vibrant. They somehow made it not feel corny, and luffy's devil fruit actually looks really good on screen. I'm so stoked to keep watching; the whole time I was watching I was laughing and cheering because it was like seeing a long lost friend. Heck, this stuff was well over 1000 episodes ago! The music they used with the scene with shanks and crew was direct from the show too. My god, I love one piece. I'm really glad that even episode one made me feel this happy. Even if the rest of the show is bad (which I highly doubt that it will be), this show remains a 10 for me. Give this one a chance lads, this is a rare success.",31-Aug-23,10.0,absolutely loved first episode im caught anime manga sorry folks fantastic interpretation one piece thought would like live action anime adaptations wrong energetic well choreographed vibrant somehow made feel corny luffys devil fruit actually looks really good screen im stoked keep watching whole time watching laughing cheering like seeing long lost friend heck stuff well episodes ago music used scene shanks crew direct show god love one piece im really glad even episode one made feel happy even rest show bad highly doubt show remains give one chance lads rare success
one piece live action is amazing,"The long-awaited live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" has finally arrived, and it's a rollercoaster ride of adventure, nostalgia, and excitement. As a dedicated fan of the original anime and manga series, I approached this adaptation with a mix of anticipation and skepticism. However, I'm thrilled to report that the creators have managed to capture the heart and soul of ""One Piece"" while delivering a fresh and engaging experience for both loyal fans and newcomers.

One of the most remarkable aspects of the live-action adaptation is the impeccable casting. The actors embody the beloved characters we've grown to love over the years, bringing them to life in a way that feels both authentic and refreshing. From Monkey D. Luffy's boundless energy and determination to Roronoa Zoro's unwavering loyalty and impressive swordsmanship, each character's essence is faithfully portrayed. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, reflecting the deep bonds that the Straw Hat crew shares. It's evident that the casting team took great care in selecting individuals who not only resemble the characters physically but also capture their personalities flawlessly.

Visually, the live-action ""One Piece"" is a feast for the eyes. The vibrant and sprawling world of the Grand Line has been beautifully reimagined, with attention to detail that will surely delight fans. The creativity and craftsmanship put into replicating iconic locations like Water 7 and Dressrosa are truly commendable. The CGI and practical effects seamlessly blend to create a universe that feels both fantastical and authentic. From the awe-inspiring Thousand Sunny to the eerie and mysterious Thriller Bark, the adaptation's visual effects team has gone above and beyond to make the One Piece world come alive in ways we could only dream of.

Of course, no ""One Piece"" adaptation would be complete without its share of epic battles and action sequences. The choreography and execution of these scenes are nothing short of spectacular. Watching Luffy stretch his rubbery limbs and Zoro unleash his signature sword techniques in real life is a dream come true for fans. The adrenaline-pumping confrontations with iconic villains like Arlong, Crocodile, and Doflamingo are reimagined with meticulous attention to detail, honoring the original while adding cinematic flair. The battles not only showcase the characters' combat skills but also their growth, camaraderie, and unwavering determination in the face of adversity.

While staying true to the source material, the live-action adaptation also takes creative liberties that enhance the storytelling experience. Certain arcs have been expanded upon, offering deeper insights into character motivations and relationships. These additions enrich the narrative, providing a fresh perspective for fans who are already familiar with the events of the series. Additionally, newcomers to the ""One Piece"" world will find the adaptation accessible and engaging, thanks to the well-paced exposition and character introductions.

One of the most delightful surprises of the live-action adaptation is its ability to evoke the same range of emotions as the original series. The humor, the heartwarming moments, and the gut-wrenching tragedies are all masterfully portrayed. The adaptation's writing captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's storytelling, ensuring that the emotional resonance that made ""One Piece"" a global phenomenon is maintained in this new format.

In conclusion, the ""One Piece"" live-action adaptation is a triumph that pays homage to its source material while boldly charting its own course. The exceptional casting, stunning visuals, exhilarating action, and emotional depth all contribute to an experience that is both faithful to the original and excitingly fresh. Whether you're a die-hard fan who has followed Luffy's journey from the beginning or a newcomer eager to explore the Grand Line for the first time, this adaptation has something for everyone. It's a celebration of adventure, friendship, and the enduring spirit of pursuing one's dreams - all fundamental themes that have made ""One Piece"" an enduring masterpiece.",31-Aug-23,10.0,longawaited liveaction adaptation one piece finally arrived rollercoaster ride adventure nostalgia excitement dedicated fan original anime manga series approached adaptation mix anticipation skepticism however im thrilled report creators managed capture heart soul one piece delivering fresh engaging experience loyal fans newcomers one remarkable aspects liveaction adaptation impeccable casting actors embody beloved characters weve grown love years bringing life way feels authentic refreshing monkey luffys boundless energy determination roronoa zoros unwavering loyalty impressive swordsmanship characters essence faithfully portrayed chemistry among cast members palpable reflecting deep bonds straw hat crew shares evident casting team took great care selecting individuals resemble characters physically also capture personalities flawlessly visually liveaction one piece feast eyes vibrant sprawling world grand line beautifully reimagined attention detail surely delight fans creativity craftsmanship put replicating iconic locations like water dressrosa truly commendable cgi practical effects seamlessly blend create universe feels fantastical authentic aweinspiring thousand sunny eerie mysterious thriller bark adaptations visual effects team gone beyond make one piece world come alive ways could dream course one piece adaptation would complete without share epic battles action sequences choreography execution scenes nothing short spectacular watching luffy stretch rubbery limbs zoro unleash signature sword techniques real life dream come true fans adrenalinepumping confrontations iconic villains like arlong crocodile doflamingo reimagined meticulous attention detail honoring original adding cinematic flair battles showcase characters combat skills also growth camaraderie unwavering determination face adversity staying true source material liveaction adaptation also takes creative liberties enhance storytelling experience certain arcs expanded upon offering deeper insights character motivations relationships additions enrich narrative providing fresh perspective fans already familiar events series additionally newcomers one piece world find adaptation accessible engaging thanks wellpaced exposition character introductions one delightful surprises liveaction adaptation ability evoke range emotions original series humor heartwarming moments gutwrenching tragedies masterfully portrayed adaptations writing captures essence eiichiro odas storytelling ensuring emotional resonance made one piece global phenomenon maintained new format conclusion one piece liveaction adaptation triumph pays homage source material boldly charting course exceptional casting stunning visuals exhilarating action emotional depth contribute experience faithful original excitingly fresh whether youre diehard fan followed luffys journey beginning newcomer eager explore grand line first time adaptation something everyone celebration adventure friendship enduring spirit pursuing ones dreams fundamental themes made one piece enduring masterpiece

An Authentic One Piece Experience,"I recently had the pleasure of watching Netflix's adaptation of One Piece, and I must admit, my worries were put to rest. The cast that initially had me concerned turned out to be an absolute delight, delivering performances that truly did justice to the beloved characters. It's safe to say that their acting prowess greatly contributed to the overall enjoyment of the show.

One of the most impressive aspects of this adaptation is how faithfully it adheres to the original plot. The storyline remained intact and impeccably executed, ensuring that viewers like me remained captivated from start to finish. The pacing was well-thought-out, allowing the narrative to unfold naturally and keeping us engaged throughout the series.

When it comes to the visual elements, Netflix certainly spared no expense. The visual effects and CGI seamlessly blended with the live-action scenes, enhancing the show's overall appeal. This careful attention to detail significantly contributed to the immersion factor, making the One Piece world come alive on screen.

However, it's not all praise. There's one particular aspect that left me slightly disappointed - the costume choices. While the performances and plot were on point, the costumes seemed to veer towards resembling stage drama attire at times. This decision felt slightly out of place, especially within the context of the show's vibrant and intricate universe. It's a minor grievance that, unfortunately, distracted me momentarily from an otherwise remarkable experience.

In conclusion, Netflix's adaptation of One Piece stands as a commendable triumph. With exceptional acting, a faithful plot, and impressive visual effects, the series captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece and delivers an enjoyable rendition. While the costume choices might leave something to be desired, they do not overshadow the overall achievement of bringing this beloved story to life in such an engaging and captivating manner.",31-Aug-23,9.0,recently pleasure watching netflixs adaptation one piece must admit worries put rest cast initially concerned turned absolute delight delivering performances truly justice beloved characters safe say acting prowess greatly contributed overall enjoyment show one impressive aspects adaptation faithfully adheres original plot storyline remained intact impeccably executed ensuring viewers like remained captivated start finish pacing wellthoughtout allowing narrative unfold naturally keeping us engaged throughout series comes visual elements netflix certainly spared expense visual effects cgi seamlessly blended liveaction scenes enhancing shows overall appeal careful attention detail significantly contributed immersion factor making one piece world come alive screen however praise theres one particular aspect left slightly disappointed costume choices performances plot point costumes seemed veer towards resembling stage drama attire times decision felt slightly place especially within context shows vibrant intricate universe minor grievance unfortunately distracted momentarily otherwise remarkable experience conclusion netflixs adaptation one piece stands commendable triumph exceptional acting faithful plot impressive visual effects series captures essence eiichiro odas masterpiece delivers enjoyable rendition costume choices might leave something desired overshadow overall achievement bringing beloved story life engaging captivating manner
A revolutionary production and step towards Anime live action,"As a man who has spent his teenage years with anime, manga, and movies, I am honored to write a confident review on the live action adaption of One Piece.

Without being biased or heavily influenced even as someone who watched 700 episodes of the anime in a summer, this series is a masterpiece. In one sentence, "" You don't feel left out, you are drawn in to the world of One Piece in this adaption as if you are part of this world.""

Live Action anime adaptations have this stigma of being inaccurate, vastly different, or twisted beyond measure, etc. Even I had a tendency to avoid watching anime live action adaptions since most of them weren't that good (like the infamous DBZ movie). Besides that, this series, One Piece on Netflix, is the very first adaptation that sets the record for appealing to both anime/manga fans and casual watchers of series.

What I find the most impressive, features on the live action series not sticking to the manga completely and making it work. The pacing is different to the anime, but its absolutely perfect as it doesn't feel too slow or fast. It is just right, enough to allow us to become comfortable with the characters and truly enjoy what is going on.

I hope this series will continue for a very long time, its worth watching with your full attention.",15-Sep-23,10.0,man spent teenage years anime manga movies honored write confident review live action adaption one piece without biased heavily influenced even someone watched episodes anime summer series masterpiece one sentence dont feel left drawn world one piece adaption part world live action anime adaptations stigma inaccurate vastly different twisted beyond measure etc even tendency avoid watching anime live action adaptions since werent good like infamous dbz movie besides series one piece netflix first adaptation sets record appealing animemanga fans casual watchers series find impressive features live action series sticking manga completely making work pacing different anime absolutely perfect doesnt feel slow fast right enough allow us become comfortable characters truly enjoy going hope series continue long time worth watching full attention
I'm actually pleasantly surprised,"There have been numerous articles talking about how hard they worked on this and how much the creator had a hand in it. I chalked it up to the used car salesman routine. This is actually really well done. The actors do a great job, and even pick up some of the mannerisms of their characters. The story is more concise and deviates but you have to expect that when you condense a whole story arc to 8 episodes.

The cool part is it's not a carbon copy of the cartoon, it adds more depth to some of the characters, like Garp and Koby.

I was worried about how they would handle CGI but it surprisingly holds up. The settings are really well made up as well.

This was a really great watch.",01-Sep-23,10.0,numerous articles talking hard worked much creator hand chalked used car salesman routine actually really well done actors great job even pick mannerisms characters story concise deviates expect condense whole story arc episodes cool part carbon copy cartoon adds depth characters like garp koby worried would handle cgi surprisingly holds settings really well made well really great watch
Great Netflix series in a long time,"I am not a fan of the original story nor I knew of it before this live action by Netflix but as soon as I saw the trailer, I had to at least try this. And it was so worth it. I finished it in less than 24 hours and still want it more. As soon as I finished it, I went straight to google searching for new of second season. And there it was, the announcement of second season of this global hit. It is so energetic and radiating positive energy throughout the story. Even in dark/sad times which leaves you with great feeling. And the lead Monkey D Luffy (I√±aki Godoy) is amazing. That anything is possible attitude and greatness smile just makes your day.

"As both and avid anime and live action movie fan, this might birth a new genre.","There are a lot of things that can wrong with a live action adaptation of an anime but Netflix's One Piece avoids almost all pitfalls in this genre. Most of the live action adaptations of anime usually focus too much on the realistic aspects of the project and kill off the atmosphere of the original series.

The One Piece series catches the perfect balance between the realistic and the wonky aspects of the show. The parts that have been altered are for the good of the adaptation and the parts that HAVE to be in there are executed perfectly, keeping the imagery consistent.

I quite enjoyed the not-so-serious atmosphere of the series. Costume, makeup, set design and action felt at just the right scale where it isn't distracting from reality but perfectly resembles the One Piece world. The acting and the writing are clearly made by people who care about the world and it shows.

I think this show might be a game changer in live action films/series like the spider-verse was a game changer in animation.",31-Aug-23,9.0,lot things wrong live action adaptation anime netflixs one piece avoids almost pitfalls genre live action adaptations anime usually focus much realistic aspects project kill atmosphere original series one piece series catches perfect balance realistic wonky aspects show parts altered good adaptation parts executed perfectly keeping imagery consistent quite enjoyed notsoserious atmosphere series costume makeup set design action felt right scale isnt distracting reality perfectly resembles one piece world acting writing clearly made people care world shows think show might game changer live action filmsseries like spiderverse game changer animation
The Legend Begins?,"I had tons of fun in the moment but core issues with the show absolutely exist. I would give it a B- after sleeping on it. The 10.5 volumes this adapts also get the same score but for different reasons. I like how this bucks the manga¬¥s unwillingness to kill people in the present leading to actual stakes and the arcs are far less isolated here. The show also looks more ""pirate-y"" than it¬¥s source material. The manga of course became less episodic once the Grand Line was reached but I will admit that the show¬¥s expanded marines B-plot needs trimming so not all of the ""improvements"" fully work. I liked ep 1-2 the most and ep 3-4 the least. Syrup Village is, of course, a mess in the manga itself. Ep 5-6 come close to the early high. Ep 7-8 are simply too packed and its well-acted take on Arlong is a bit too weak to fully work. I am glad that my favorite crew member Zoro shined the brightest and Mackenyu was born to play him. The core crew is nailed, even if Sanji and Usop got less time than needed, as Zoro and Nami got additional scenes that took away focus from them. The best villain is of course Buggy and the funniest character. The most important foundational stones are there for what comes next to work and the sets and most costumes exceeded any expectations. The bombastic score is another winner but is a bit overused. The anime has the same musical problem as it is a bit too epic and loud at times. The show¬¥s underuse of CG is hopefully a S1 problem but budget issues will only grow from here. The manga¬¥s settings and powers go bonkers after the upcoming Arabasta Saga, to put it mildly. Even its fire, limb growing, sand and smoke powers will be a challenge. Let¬¥s not even think about the transforming reindeer boy as the show still has to commit to Luffy¬¥s stretchiness. What we need next is better cinematography and actual establishing shots. A bit more room to breathe, one more ep for Arlong Park would have done wonders here as the enslaved village is underused, and seasons of at least 10 eps are a must. S1 just fades out and even non-fans should feel that something is missing. That was likely out of the showrunner's hands but we could have ended on one of the best scenes in the manga/anime instead of starting S2 with a double climax.

It¬¥s a miracle that any of this is even watchable, even if only the easiest-to-adapt part of One Piece was used. All involved deserve a standing ovation! Rurouni Kenshin live action this isn¬¥t despite the budget per minute likely being similar or higher but the Bebop studio came close. And what a glow-up after that abortion! No one is expecting a full adaptation but I would be shocked if we don¬¥t get at least a 2nd season to show the true manga. Netflix Piece will go down in legend if it only ends after 1 season as I can¬¥t see another crew sail the Grand Line after seeing this one formed so well.

PS: Don¬¥t bother with the anime adaptation as its pacing and visuals sadly fall apart after the Skypia arc. No filler episode list can solve its issues unlike let¬¥s say Naruto.

The Must-Watch Series of the Year: One Piece on Netflix Delivers an Unforgettable Cinematic Experience,"As a fan of One piece anime, I was initially skeptical when I heard that Netflix would be adapting it into a live-action series. However, after watching the trailers then watching the live action series, I was pleasantly surprised by how well the adaptation was executed. The live-action series not only stayed true to the original IP ( story line ) , but it also managed to capture the essence of One piece in a way that felt fresh and exciting.

I have to emphasize that I am completely unbiased in saying this - as a viewer, I was able to fully immerse myself in the world of the live-action series without any preconceived notions or biases. And, I have to say that it was worth the wait. The attention to detail in the costumes, sets, and special effects was impressive, and the performances by the actors were top-notch.

Of course, like any adaptation, there were some small errors in the first season that could be improved upon in a potential second season. But overall, the live-action series was a joy to watch, and I am eagerly hoping for a second season to see how the story and characters will continue to develop.

All in all, Netflix did an excellent job adapting this beloved anime into a live-action series, and I would highly recommend it to both fans of the original IP and newcomers alike.",31-Aug-23,10.0,fan one piece anime initially skeptical heard netflix would adapting liveaction series however watching trailers watching live action series pleasantly surprised well adaptation executed liveaction series stayed true original ip story line also managed capture essence one piece way felt fresh exciting emphasize completely unbiased saying viewer able fully immerse world liveaction series without preconceived notions biases say worth wait attention detail costumes sets special effects impressive performances actors topnotch course like adaptation small errors first season could improved upon potential second season overall liveaction series joy watch eagerly hoping second season see story characters continue develop netflix excellent job adapting beloved anime liveaction series would highly recommend fans original ip newcomers alike
How.is.it.this.good???,"I attempted to watch the anime twice, but just couldn't get into it. Then I saw how Cowboy Bebop was massacred by Netflix, so to say I started this series with apprehension is an understatement. But hey, I kept reading that they delivered on this one. So I figured I'd give it a shot.

Wow.

Raw, goofy, unrestricted fun. Entertainment even! I'm definitely not shocked to learn that the creator, Eiichiro Oda, was heavily involved, even prompting reshoots when the narrative/characters seemed to drift. The story is tight- characters are consistent, the writing is simple and not over cluttered.

The acting is also incredible. The performers sell these over-the-top personalities when needed, but also show great emotional range when the audience is privy to their vulnerabilities.

All of that aside, this would be meaninglessness if not for Oda's underlying tale. The heart of the story, which I'd long heard about in the anime, is on showcase with this adaptation. The story of following one's dreams and defying oppression cuts through the noise of most entertainment with a sense of sincerity that is touching.

Very, very well done. I can't wait until season 2, but I in the meantime I guess there's an anime out there that deserves a third chance.",24-Sep-23,10.0,attempted watch anime twice couldnt get saw cowboy bebop massacred netflix say started series apprehension understatement hey kept reading delivered one figured id give shot wow raw goofy unrestricted fun entertainment even im definitely shocked learn creator eiichiro oda heavily involved even prompting reshoots narrativecharacters seemed drift story tight characters consistent writing simple cluttered acting also incredible performers sell overthetop personalities needed also show great emotional range audience privy vulnerabilities aside would meaninglessness odas underlying tale heart story id long heard anime showcase adaptation story following ones dreams defying oppression cuts noise entertainment sense sincerity touching well done cant wait season meantime guess theres anime deserves third chance
"Sit back, relax, enjoy","This is no smart stuff, pure and simple emotions, whacky characters, simple jokes, but all together it creates that magic that brings the joy. I would also point out the acting, which I liked a lot. Kinda reminded me of ""Bunraku"", everything is a bit exaggerated, but not over the top, so I got that theatrical feeling. Cameraman work was splendid, to my taste. The shots and the angles, I liked it a lot, really helped me emerge into the atmosphere. And the music and overall sound design, all the gunshots, sword sounds, ship sounds, everything was on point. I also liked that the ""superpowers"" were not used without reason, and that they were not that powerful. In the end, it is all about the characters and personalities, rather that a bit-em-up power fantasy.

A really good adaptation, rare sight, highly recommend even if you haven't seen the anime.",03-Sep-23,9.0,smart stuff pure simple emotions whacky characters simple jokes together creates magic brings joy would also point acting liked lot kinda reminded bunraku everything bit exaggerated top got theatrical feeling cameraman work splendid taste shots angles liked lot really helped emerge atmosphere music overall sound design gunshots sword sounds ship sounds everything point also liked superpowers used without reason powerful end characters personalities rather bitemup power fantasy really good adaptation rare sight highly recommend even havent seen anime
How do I like this so much ???,"I consider myself a lurking anime fan. I don't like all anime but I won't shy away from giving it a chance. That being said, there is still only a small pocket of material I actually enjoy. I gave the anime version of One Piece a chance and couldn't make it past the first episode or two, though am familiar with the lore.

But this. This drew me in almost immediately and kept me engaged the entire time. It's the perfect level of serious, wholesome, and zany without shying away from violence but not being gratuitous.

Each character is uniquely distinct and interesting, again, without being too over the top. It has the perfect blend of almost everything one could want.

This is what a proper adaptation can be. It's ok to not follow the source material for plot exactly as long as the characters are there and their motivations stay intact.

I can't wait until Netflix cancels this one after one season.",02-Sep-23,10.0,consider lurking anime fan dont like anime wont shy away giving chance said still small pocket material actually enjoy gave anime version one piece chance couldnt make past first episode two though familiar lore drew almost immediately kept engaged entire time perfect level serious wholesome zany without shying away violence gratuitous character uniquely distinct interesting without top perfect blend almost everything one could want proper adaptation ok follow source material plot exactly long characters motivations stay intact cant wait netflix cancels one one season

Feelgood Fun and so much that's good,"I don't know anything about the anime, so this review is purely on the Netflix show without any consideration or comparison for the anime.

Once piece is really amazing. At first I was uncertain about it, but after a friend recommended it I gave it a try.

It has a very anime feel to it. It's over the top, but not too much. Luffy, the captain, has such an inspiring optimism about him, I can't help but smile.

There are so many likable characters. They are complex and multi-faceted. Each have their own strength, each are interesting. Female characters show strength and depth without needing to make men incompetent and useless.

The casting is on point. The scene, setting and acting are extravagant but it totally fits the anime style. The technology level and fashion is all over the place which adds a fun creativity to it.

The writing is excellent, the story flow is great and every episode has something special to it. It's so feelgood. I'm left smiling often and it even tugged a tear out at times.

Highly recommend. Please netflix, make more things this.",17-Sep-23,10.0,dont know anything anime review purely netflix show without consideration comparison anime piece really amazing first uncertain friend recommended gave try anime feel top much luffy captain inspiring optimism cant help smile many likable characters complex multifaceted strength interesting female characters show strength depth without needing make men incompetent useless casting point scene setting acting extravagant totally fits anime style technology level fashion place adds fun creativity writing excellent story flow great every episode something special feelgood im left smiling often even tugged tear times highly recommend please netflix make things
Absolutely fantastic!,"I have not seen the anime or read the manga, and I only just finished thr 3rd episode, but I cannot keep in just how much I am enjoying this show. This is the only US production I have loooooved since Game of Thrones season 1 came out 12 years ago (which was ruined in season 6 after Hollywood writing took over). Given how great it is I am assuming Hollywood did not take many liberties, and it is quite evident.

This is SO much fun to watch, the writing is great (and not cringe as it has been for over a decade), the visuals and the casting is PERFECT! I cannot imagine anyone else would do as perfect a job as the actor for Luffy... who was brilliant!

First episode was ok,"I liked the first episode as a spin-off. Casting was good, but that's it. From the second episode forward, it's just a regular cheap bad series, doing a One Piece cosplay. When people mentioned the budget was like that of GOT, I guess they meant the budget of a single GOT episode to create the whole show, or maybe they spent all that money on marketing, because it was certainly no employed on the show. Just another bad series not worth anybody's time. This is One Piece ""interpreted"" by an idiot. A poor idiot at that. People saying the series is great are clearly lying, or not reliable. Maybe this is the first tv show they have ever watched and they'll probably change their opinions when they discover something like HBO.",04-Sep-23,3.0,liked first episode spinoff casting good thats second episode forward regular cheap bad series one piece cosplay people mentioned budget like got guess meant budget single got episode create whole show maybe spent money marketing certainly employed show another bad series worth anybodys time one piece interpreted idiot poor idiot people saying series great clearly lying reliable maybe first tv show ever watched theyll probably change opinions discover something like hbo

I couldn't stop watching this show and got blown away with the water filled world with fish people, pirate legends, rubber people, violence, death and humour.

It's much better than expected !!!,"As a die hard One Piece fan I was so scared about this but turns out be very good it literally blew my expectations about Anime to Live Actions. Man I'm so happy that turns out be so good. Huge props to the Cast and the Production team they did a really good job no a excellent job with acting and making backgrounds, music and everything. Obviously the storyline line is kinda different a from the original Anime & Manga and some parts are left out but it's fine cuz Live Actions don't have the freedom that Anime gets they need to give an maximum output with limited episodes and resources. They did a really good job with pacing I think it was very well done. Again I'm so happy with this series and I hope there will be a Season 2 for this.

Miraculous Casting,"Somehow One Piece has elevated the format of Direct-to-Netflix anime adaptations. It's so unique and distinct. Utterly absurd, thrilling, and tragic. Every moment feels so lovingly crafted, and performed. I've never seen any of these young actors before, but I'm taken aback by the charming, earnest performances. Everyone is pitch perfect and distinct in believable ways. The casting is brilliant. Who knew these characters could be realized so well? It feels like I'm watching Star Wars for the first time, including a memorable soundtrack. Can't wait for more. My only lament would be that many scenes take place in a nebulous, foggy dreamland, where there's nothing to look at but the characters. I hope the show gains in production budget and quality so they can really indulge in some beautiful scenery.",21-Sep-23,9.0,somehow one piece elevated format directtonetflix anime adaptations unique distinct utterly absurd thrilling tragic every moment feels lovingly crafted performed ive never seen young actors im taken aback charming earnest performances everyone pitch perfect distinct believable ways casting brilliant knew characters could realized well feels like im watching star wars first time including memorable soundtrack cant wait lament would many scenes take place nebulous foggy dreamland theres nothing look characters hope show gains production budget quality really indulge beautiful scenery
Thank You Netflix !,"This show is incredibly well done. It is rare to see an adaptation that manages to do it's own thing while never losing the original spirit of the material; this show manages to capture the best of both worlds. While some things are different, the writers managed to condense and move things around from the original source material without actual changing very much. This change sets up so much world building and characterization while setting a good, engaging pace for the live action series. It is also very exciting as a One Piece fan to pick up the hints and Easter eggs that I wasn't anticipating on being included . In fact, because some things are different, it makes for a very exciting rewatch. The casting is perfect. Nami, Zoro, and Sanji have stand out performances but the energy of the entire crew is electric. The sets are stunning, it made me breathless at times. But the fight scenes just stood out above the rest. Honestly, I love fight scenes but I'm not a huge fan of fight scenes in anime. I am a fan of One Piece for the awesome story, adventure, and crew. But these fight scenes were so well done that I've been finding myself wanting to go back and rewatch them. Watching Zoro and Sanji fight has been something else. I was stunned the first time Zoro fought in the show, I wasn't not expecting the action in this show to be so good. This blew my expectations out of the water. This show has things for old fans and potential new fans alike. It's fast paced, easy to digest, and very faithful to the spirit of the show. If you've been wanting to get someone to try One Piece, this is a very mass market friendly way to dip their toes in. I'd recommend this show to just about anyone.",02-Sep-23,10.0,show incredibly well done rare see adaptation manages thing never losing original spirit material show manages capture best worlds things different writers managed condense move things around original source material without actual changing much change sets much world building characterization setting good engaging pace live action series also exciting one piece fan pick hints easter eggs wasnt anticipating included fact things different makes exciting rewatch casting perfect nami zoro sanji stand performances energy entire crew electric sets stunning made breathless times fight scenes stood rest honestly love fight scenes im huge fan fight scenes anime fan one piece awesome story adventure crew fight scenes well done ive finding wanting go back rewatch watching zoro sanji fight something else stunned first time zoro fought show wasnt expecting action show good blew expectations water show things old fans potential new fans alike fast paced easy digest faithful spirit show youve wanting get someone try one piece mass market friendly way dip toes id recommend show anyone
"Yes folks, it's good. They did it.","Writing this after watching all 8 episodes.

Oda was most certainly involved in this because in no way does this ever feel like a shameless product by Netflix to capitalize on, this feels like a project made by someone who always had a vision for his work and was surrounded by people who wanted to bring his vision to life and do it justice.

The cast is so good. To me personally, Morgan Davies as Koby steals the show for how damn accurate his portrayal of the character is. It is not fair to say one actor is stronger than the others, because everyone feels right for their part.

Now of course, please watch with some degree of leeway. It will probably always be impossible for an live action adaptation of an anime to feel EXACTLY like it's source, visuals-wise. There are sadly things made in anime that can only work if done in anime. This adaptation does however feel as close as possible to it's beloved source material and never reaching the point where it doesn't work anymore.

8/10, fans of One piece, I can't really see you being dissapointed by this. The cast and crew of this adaptation genuily cared, and each one of them should be appreciated.",31-Aug-23,8.0,writing watching episodes oda certainly involved way ever feel like shameless product netflix capitalize feels like project made someone always vision work surrounded people wanted bring vision life justice cast good personally morgan davies koby steals show damn accurate portrayal character fair say one actor stronger others everyone feels right part course please watch degree leeway probably always impossible live action adaptation anime feel exactly like source visualswise sadly things made anime work done anime adaptation however feel close possible beloved source material never reaching point doesnt work anymore fans one piece cant really see dissapointed cast crew adaptation genuily cared one appreciated

"Weird,Wild and Wonderful...","After reading overwhelmingly positive reviews on this one I decided to 'give it a go'. Although I love Anime I was not familiar with this IP but I was hooked within a few minutes, from the colourful palette to the bright and breezy characters,i couldn't get enough of it. I understand that the original creator was heavily involved and it showed in spades..(..note to 'Witcher' crew,if you don't like the Characters you are working with,for everyone's sake,stop wasting everyone's time and go and do something else,instead...). I would say that this Show is definitely one of the best things I have seen on 'Netflix' and can not wait for series 2. I enjoyed seeing a bunch of mostly new faces,(..though,scenery- chewers Vince-300-Regan and Craig-Eastenders-Fairbrass were super fun...),and they all added to the enjoyment,'Goodies' and 'Baddies' alike. I loved the themes of standing by family and friends and M D Luffy's effervescent smile and optimism were a constant source of enjoyment. I've no need to really go into the other characters as you need to see for yourselves, if you are any sort of a Fantasy Fan,I think this is unmissable fun and I cannot wait for more.

Another wasted opportunity - yet the best live-action adaption so far.,"*EDIT - After finishing the entire first season I have to bump the score up to a solid 7 maybe even 7.5, although you can look for a lot of mistakes it most certainly is the best anime live-action adaption to date and you have to give credit to the people involved, I'm still too cheap to give it an 8 because of the pacing and changes to some of the characters unique features, but i was impressed for sure.

Original review

I had very low expectations of this show, expecting I would give it 3/10 or so, but I must say that it exceeded my expectations.

You have to be very forgiving if comparing it to the anime or manga though.

**Storytelling 5/10** The storytelling is very rushed, I can enjoy it because I have seen the anime, but as a new person I would feel like it was a mess.

**Characters 5/10**

It look almost like a theater adaption, very few of the characters actually look like they do in the anime, instead they look like a normal humans in make-up(which ofc they are).

Alvida, instead of being a 6'6""(1.98m) giant woman in both girth and height with a huge club the size of a teenager, is just a normal sized chubby woman with a spiked baseball bat.

Axe Hand Morgan, instead of being a 9'4"" (2.85m) giant buffed man, is just a normal sized semi-buff man.

Arlong, instead of being a giant 8'7"" (2.63m) Fish-Man, is just a normal sized dude in blue paint with a fake nose.

Etc.

I mean they really could have done a better job in that regard.

They literally turned giants into normal sized people.

But at least the characters are recognizable, but I mean that should be a given.

**Animation quality and world build 8/10**

You can see that they have spent money on the show, which makes it even more surprising that the characters look so off..

But the animation quality and world build is actually pretty decent, enough so that you are able to see how this is a such a missed opportunity..

Overall score 6.5/10

It is definitely not a 1 nor a 10 on my scale.

I was considering 4 or 5 but Luffy charmed me up to a 6, even with the mexican accent he sometimes has.

It depends on how you want to judge it, as a true adaption it's too rushed and the characters too bland, they also changed a lot of things because of the rush.

For me, that has seen the anime, it's a fun waste of time, something to play in the background and having a laugh here and there and reminiscing about the past.

I think new people might have a hard time liking the show, seeing at it is so very rushed, you hardly get to know any of the villains before it's on to the next.

But comparing it to basically any other Live-Action adaption I have to say this is the best so far (but I'm still sad that they didn't stay more true to the anime/manga).",31-Aug-23,7.0,edit finishing entire first season bump score solid maybe even although look lot mistakes certainly best anime liveaction adaption date give credit people involved im still cheap give pacing changes characters unique features impressed sure original review low expectations show expecting would give must say exceeded expectations forgiving comparing anime manga though storytelling storytelling rushed enjoy seen anime new person would feel like mess characters look almost like theater adaption characters actually look like anime instead look like normal humans makeupwhich ofc alvida instead giant woman girth height huge club size teenager normal sized chubby woman spiked baseball bat axe hand morgan instead giant buffed man normal sized semibuff man arlong instead giant fishman normal sized dude blue paint fake nose etc mean really could done better job regard literally turned giants normal sized people least characters recognizable mean given animation quality world build see spent money show makes even surprising characters look animation quality world build actually pretty decent enough able see missed opportunity overall score definitely scale considering luffy charmed even mexican accent sometimes depends want judge true adaption rushed characters bland also changed lot things rush seen anime fun waste time something play background laugh reminiscing past think new people might hard time liking show seeing rushed hardly get know villains next comparing basically liveaction adaption say best far im still sad didnt stay true animemanga
"Childish in a bad way, and so cringe","This is so bad. Apparently based on some anime which I have not seen and cannot compare with. But this is what you write when you have been eating too much Fugu and are seeing flashes of your life before you move on.

Not a single person on this show act naturally. Not one. The directing is off sure, but the acting is as well. No one goes on a journey or learn anything, there is no progression of characters. Instead these people act and behave as animated characters stuck in some feverish political dream. This is very diverse in a very strange way, and it just feels unnatural, wrong, off somehow. Speaking of ""off"", the wardrobe department for this show really smoked something weird. I don't know if they simply just copied from the animated series, but again they all dress in the most unnatural way.

This is not all horrible. A few scenes are kinda cool, the sets are okay for TV budget and although the writing, directing, acting and costumes are all very unnatural I get the feeling, without knowing, they are doing so to stay true to the source material. If so that is a positive, but you also need to adopt to the medium at hand.

I give the season a generous 3/10. This probably should have a lower score, but as said it is not completely awful and today you could definitely do worse.

"Oda's vision, Mackenyu's performance","It seems that Hollywood productions got wise to the fact that if you wanna work to get the best live action from Japanese manga include the author! It's seems like a no brainer and it's surprising it took this long. Visually this series is stunning and the casting, with Oda's approval, checks all the boxes in bringing the manga to live action. Mackenyu is brilliant and definitely the stand out performance. His action scenes are amazing. His skills with two swords is effortless and smooth. The other thing about his performance is how he's able to maintain the juvenile, playful fun of the series and yet give it an adult spin with his acting. It's why he shines above the rest of the cast. Inagki Godoy has the childish innocence that is a great match with Mackenyu and really embodies Luffy. While each episode seems self contained and a bit minimal in some respect, it matches the essence of Japanese manga and keeps it accessible to a broad age range. The fact that Oda was able to have editing and approval over the script is the key here. Overall, this will appeal to both fans and non fans of One Piece. It's hard to believe I'm saying this, but maybe the code has been cracked. Any studio wanting to translate Japanese manga into live action take note...include the author who knows better than you how to translate his manga.",31-Aug-23,8.0,seems hollywood productions got wise fact wanna work get best live action japanese manga include author seems like brainer surprising took long visually series stunning casting odas approval checks boxes bringing manga live action mackenyu brilliant definitely stand performance action scenes amazing skills two swords effortless smooth thing performance hes able maintain juvenile playful fun series yet give adult spin acting shines rest cast inagki godoy childish innocence great match mackenyu really embodies luffy episode seems self contained bit minimal respect matches essence japanese manga keeps accessible broad age range fact oda able editing approval script key overall appeal fans non fans one piece hard believe im saying maybe code cracked studio wanting translate japanese manga live action take noteinclude author knows better translate manga

Gum Gum nooo cringeeee,"I thought this series will be totally cringe but to my surprise it was excellent. Well paced no absurd scenes and the casting is good too. I really like luffy and nami. Zoro is kind of ok but there is less dialogue for him. Zoro is also my favourite character from the anime so hopefully in future arcs there will be more of him.

CGI is not bad at all. I had really low expectations for this series maybe that was why it surpassed my expectations.

Every single cast member is new so no one really stood out except from Emily Rudd. I have seen her appear on the internet for a while.

The story and dialogue is coherent with the anime. I have not read the manga so I have no idea about that.

THIS DIDN'T DISAPPOINT AS A FAN,"This live action did not disappoint. I've been a fan since the early 2000s, and after numerous episodes, it's good to come back and revisit the introductory journey of the Straw Hat Pirates.

The sequence flow is perfect; there's no dead moment. The OG crew was introduced well, and all their dreams and goals are inspiring.

Their voices fit the roles, and the CG/visuals aren't cringe-worthy at all. Even the background music fits the scene. I don't know how to convince those in doubt any further. Please watch and support! I can't wait for the next arc in Loguetown.

One Piece: A Perfect Adaptation,"I was particularly impressed with the way the series captured the humor and heart of the original material. The characters are all well-developed and relatable, and the series is full of moments of joy and laughter. I also thought the action sequences were some of the best I've seen in a live-action adaptation of an anime. They were exciting and well-choreographed, and they did a great job of capturing the scale and scope of the original material.

One Piece is one of the most popular anime and manga series of all time, and the live-action adaptation on Netflix does not disappoint. The series follows the story of Monkey D. Luffy, a young man who dreams of becoming the Pirate King. Along the way, he assembles a crew of colorful characters and sets sail on an epic adventure.

The love for the source material, the love for details and just a lot of heart are constantly there. It is part of the cast, the set design, the directing, the score and even the camera work.

Loving this!!,"I'm a huge anime fan, but I have never seen One Piece. Due to the enormity and length of its story, it's not one I could likely endure. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden were the longest I could muster interest for. Like a lot of giant Shoenun mangas and anime, Death Note, Fullmetal, Dragon Ball and Cowboy Bebop, this is probably the first live-action adaptation of a manga to exceed expectations and actually have some depth to it, just like an anime offers.

Would recommend even to non-anime watchers. Just realise that it is based off of a Manga, so the characters, dialogue and fight scenes will be over the top and unrealistic. That is the point!

This not only blew my expectations out of the water, but it genuinely became the best live action anime adaptation I have ever seen.

You can tell a lot of effort, love and attention to detail went into this. Everything just fits and the pacing is great and I couldn't imagine a better actor for the Luffy role (these were also Oda's words).

I don't mind that this isn't a totally 100% scene by scene manga / anime copy, as long as the main memorable scenes are adapted and it has that One Piece spirit. Sure I would've like to see Hachi and his Six Sword Style, but I perfectly understand that fitting 5 story arcs within less than 8 hours of screen time is a challenge and some stuff needed to be dropped.

I watched 1000+ anime episodes in Japanese and although its weird hearing different names and attacks in English, I'm very happy with that trade-off, provided Netflix adapts other arcs just as great as these 5.

I'm also happy about the choice of not completely shying away from gore, as its very nice to see Zoro do his thing and seeing visual feedback lol.

Please Netflix, you have an amazing opportunity here. Just keep giving love to future seasons like you did with this one and you will have happy audience and a masterpiece in your catalogue.

The best anime adaptations that I have seen,"If you have no knowledge of the anime then this is a great introduction.

For fans of the anime the story has been shuffled to condense the story from 80 episodes to 8 and the story is different but with the same goal.

The power levels of most of the characters in the live action seem to be off by quite a bit from the anime, with the exception of Mihawk. I know a few other can be explained as them going easy but overall it feels to my they were trying to put too many real world physics into and anime world. The writers also wanted a slightly smarter Luffy.

I will admit that the casting choices great.",01-Sep-23,7.0,knowledge anime great introduction fans anime story shuffled condense story episodes story different goal power levels characters live action seem quite bit anime exception mihawk know explained going easy overall feels trying put many real world physics anime world writers also wanted slightly smarter luffy admit casting choices great
Incredibly fun and well produced! (And finally breaks the anime curse!),"FINALLY! An actual good live action adaption of an anime show. Almost everything about this show was done right. The casting choices for each of the characters is perfect, the costume designs, acting and mannerisms make it feel like you're literally watching an anime but with real people. Everyone is so animated and on point with their characters. I also love how the design team tried to make it as real as they could without relying solely on CGI like a lot of other shows do, this way the show feels more authentic and captivating because you know the designers took the time and creative effort to make the anime come to life instead of rushing it via CGI. The story itself for the show is super fun and captivating that makes you want to keep watching.

Even if you never watched the anime, I think you'll really enjoy this show. Give it a try! I feel Netflix needs to improve the marketing to be like their bigger hero shows, because I was not interested in this show until I decided to randomly give it a try. And it deserves a lot more compared to some of those other shows.

So good!,"OK, so I am not a fan of anime and have never heard of One Piece before, but I really loved this!

It was fun, silly, and the characters were likable and quirky.

It was also beautiful to look at; the big ships with their silly prows, the gorgeous rolling waves and blue sky, the ominous clouds.

I ended up binge watching the whole season in one day and I'm really hoping there will be a season two. I can see why it's #1 on Netflix, and I'm so glad that it was on my recommended list.

I don't know why I need to write so many characters, I've already said everything I wanted to say and it's really annoying to have to keep writing, lol.",14-Sep-23,10.0,ok fan anime never heard one piece really loved fun silly characters likable quirky also beautiful look big ships silly prows gorgeous rolling waves blue sky ominous clouds ended binge watching whole season one day im really hoping season two see netflix im glad recommended list dont know need write many characters ive already said everything wanted say really annoying keep writing lol
Disappointing..Stop Making Adaptations of such beautiful Manga and Anime.,So Let me tell you about this adaptation of One Piece. CGI was not so good .If you making something like One piece you need James Cameron level work. Characters were so out of place without proper Sync with each other. It felt like the Actors were forced off with no proper Interpretation. Storytelling was lacking in so many ways and very much fast paced even though they made into a TV series. The fighting scene were cut short so much that Mihawk and Zoro's Fight felt like a Children Fighting with swords. Baratie Arc was a total mess with many Characters cut short with story. Shanks Crew Didn't even Felt like they were any sort of Pirates. Benn Beckman looked like an old loonie lol. And that Shank's Conqueror Haki made me throw up .I was expecting much better as it's 2023 we talking but TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT.

Fantastic show,"The cast and show-runners have done an incredible job translating the wacky, over the top source material to something that works with the 8 episode tv series format. They all embody their characters, and it really shows in their dynamic on screen.

They have also done a fantastic job when adapting the source material to better fit the 8 episode format.

The CGI is for the most part really good. The show set the tone and atmosphere of the show from episode one, which made CGI which would be jarring in other shows, feel natural.

This is also helped by the stunning physical sets, and fantastic practical effects which really ground the show.

Overall a fantastic show which really captures the essence of the original Manga, and nails the live action format.",31-Aug-23,10.0,cast showrunners done incredible job translating wacky top source material something works episode tv series format embody characters really shows dynamic screen also done fantastic job adapting source material better fit episode format cgi part really good show set tone atmosphere show episode one made cgi would jarring shows feel natural also helped stunning physical sets fantastic practical effects really ground show overall fantastic show really captures essence original manga nails live action format

And now that I'm done with the pive action, I have started watching the anime One Piece as well. Netflix better approve a season 2 cause this show is AMAZING!

Great intro to One Piece for newcomers,"I had a lot of fun watching this adaptation. I have some basic knowledge of the crew but otherwise I never got into One Piece way back when it first started airing, and the thought of diving into this series has always felt overwhelming to me because of how long it is. Netflix's One Piece really surprised me and now I want to start reading the manga to explore more of this world. I know One Piece is incredibly popular and well loved and I'm starting to understand why.

I'm also glad to see that a real effort was made to create a worthy live-action adaptation. Hopefully One Piece will set a new standard for future anime adaptations.

Sure it was not perfect, the pacing did feel rushed at times and some of the cgi could have been better. But, there wasn't anything about it that took away from my experience. I loved the cast and I was hooked from start to finish. If anyone is considering checking it out I would say it's definitely worth a watch. As a newcomer myself I'm looking forward to Season 2 as well as finally reading the manga, perhaps even giving the anime a watch as well if I have the time.",13-Sep-23,9.0,lot fun watching adaptation basic knowledge crew otherwise never got one piece way back first started airing thought diving series always felt overwhelming long netflixs one piece really surprised want start reading manga explore world know one piece incredibly popular well loved im starting understand im also glad see real effort made create worthy liveaction adaptation hopefully one piece set new standard future anime adaptations sure perfect pacing feel rushed times cgi could better wasnt anything took away experience loved cast hooked start finish anyone considering checking would say definitely worth watch newcomer im looking forward season well finally reading manga perhaps even giving anime watch well time
Close to perfection,"Is this perfect? No, no show is ever perfect! Is it fun to watch? Yes, absolutely!! Is it a damn good adaption of a seemingly impossible manga to adapt?! Hell yeah!!!! Is it the best live adaptation so far? Only time will tell, but it's certainly right at the top.

I am not sure if it will be everyone's cup of tea, I kind of feel this will appeal chiefly to those who are already OP fans (which is milions of people!).

I am surprised at how well they have managed to pull off. It has a One Piecey kind of vibe even if it is a bit darker in some scenes of combat. Still, it's damn hard to build a credible goofy/spooky pirate world with crazy powers, so well done to the showmakers and actors!",31-Aug-23,10.0,perfect show ever perfect fun watch yes absolutely damn good adaption seemingly impossible manga adapt hell yeah best live adaptation far time tell certainly right top sure everyones cup tea kind feel appeal chiefly already op fans milions people surprised well managed pull one piecey kind vibe even bit darker scenes combat still damn hard build credible goofyspooky pirate world crazy powers well done showmakers actors
Amazing!,"The Netflix live-action adaptation of One Piece has pleasantly shattered my skepticism about past adaptations. This rendition easily stands as the finest I've witnessed so far. The masterful casting choices have contributed to its exceptional quality. Inaki Williams, portraying the affable Luffy, is a stroke of genius. His embodiment of the character is impeccable, and his contagious joy radiates through the screen, capturing the essence of Luffy's adventurous spirit flawlessly.

The attention to detail in the production design, costumes, and special effects further elevates the series. The vibrant and diverse world of One Piece has been faithfully recreated, bringing to life the fantastical environments and vibrant characters from the original source material.

This adaptation's ability to strike a balance between honoring the beloved manga and infusing it with new life is commendable. It respects the core of the story while offering fresh perspectives, making it an engaging experience for both long-time fans and newcomers.

As the first season unfolds, I find myself eagerly anticipating the next chapter of the story. The commitment to quality and the evident passion of the cast and crew bode well for the series' future. One Piece on Netflix is an exceptional triumph and a testament to the potential of live-action adaptations when approached with care and dedication.",31-Aug-23,10.0,netflix liveaction adaptation one piece pleasantly shattered skepticism past adaptations rendition easily stands finest ive witnessed far masterful casting choices contributed exceptional quality inaki williams portraying affable luffy stroke genius embodiment character impeccable contagious joy radiates screen capturing essence luffys adventurous spirit flawlessly attention detail production design costumes special effects elevates series vibrant diverse world one piece faithfully recreated bringing life fantastical environments vibrant characters original source material adaptations ability strike balance honoring beloved manga infusing new life commendable respects core story offering fresh perspectives making engaging experience longtime fans newcomers first season unfolds find eagerly anticipating next chapter story commitment quality evident passion cast crew bode well series future one piece netflix exceptional triumph testament potential liveaction adaptations approached care dedication
It has no business being this good,"A live action remake? On netflix? And it's... great?! This is absurd. I was almost certain this would be complete garbage but it was the most captivating show I've watched in years. Somehow it's even better than the anime. I don't know what happened here, but I pray to god they maintain the quality for the seasons to follow.

It's very clearly capped off at ""PG-13"", but you know what? I'm not even mad. It has a childish demeanor, sure, but it's complete fantasy. Something uplifting and dreamy in atmosphere. It works.

The set is better than average, the plot is very well delivered, and I was closely monitoring the acting, expecting something cheesy. But no. It is all around a very well crafted season 1.

Netflix: please god do not put politics into the seasons to follow. I know that's usually your aim.

Not an anime fan,"I don't like Anime never have especially this older stuff. Never watched one piece the cartoon or know anything about it.

I guess this is fine if your a fan of the original but someone like me that just comes in cold to watch this is not interested real quick. I'm guessing the fans will give it huge reviews and make everyone knows it has high reviews. My guess is after the hype dies down no one will care or watch it again. There will not be a second season to much money and not enough broad appeal even for netflix..

This show shouldn't have worked,"Just finished watching this. Honestly this show exceeded my expectations as it did with most people it seems like. Of course there are going to be some people who won't like it but you can't please everyone.

I thought all the Straw Hats were perfectly cast and Inaki Godoy as Luffy was especially great he's literally perfect casting. Also shoutout to Emily Rudd as Nami she was also great. Great thing about this show is it's accessible to both people who know nothing about One Piece while also staying faithful to the anime and manga.

Hopefully this can get enough viewership from people to renew it for Season 2 it's very clear that everyone behind the camera and in front of it wanted to make the best show they could possibly make. Who would've thought that One Piece would be one of the few great anime to live action adaptations? Definitely not me.

If this does get renewed for Season 2 it'll probably be a while before we see it unfortunately because of the current actor/ writer strikes going on but I am looking forward to seeing who ends up playing Ace, Smoker, Robin, Vivi and Crocodile if this does get renewed.",04-Sep-23,8.0,finished watching honestly show exceeded expectations people seems like course going people wont like cant please everyone thought straw hats perfectly cast inaki godoy luffy especially great hes literally perfect casting also shoutout emily rudd nami also great great thing show accessible people know nothing one piece also staying faithful anime manga hopefully get enough viewership people renew season clear everyone behind camera front wanted make best show could possibly make wouldve thought one piece would one great anime live action adaptations definitely get renewed season itll probably see unfortunately current actor writer strikes going looking forward seeing ends playing ace smoker robin vivi crocodile get renewed
"Somehow, they adapted it perfectly","There are aspects in this show that can't be faked by people who aren't One Piece fans. Every subtle thing that made you enjoy the anime/manga is here. They show the bounties, cool characters don't use coat sleeves, Luffy gets a different shirt for different arcs, etc. Everyone working on it knows & love One Piece. I thought I wouldn't like or care about this adaptation, but it's actually great, this is an honest 10/10.

The casting is PERFECT (even for minor characters). Shanks is the essence of cool, Buggy deserves an Oscar (he should audition as the Joker), Garp commands respect, Koby is exactly like the anime (and I really want to see that actor post time skip). The characters come from around the world so it makes sense to not make them all Japanese/white. Luffys actor gets it right with his unpredictable personality, Zoro could admittedly relax more, but still a great job.

They weren't scared of suspending realism and making it feel like an anime. People who don't watch anime might think it's cheesy, but it actually works. They walk the line, unapologetically cross it, and then take the line with them.

The sets. There needs to be an Oscar for set design, and it needs to be given to this show.

Love it,"So I wasn't sold by the adverts and just had it on as back ground noise. I must admit I am a fan now, I binged watched it in a day. I have never watched the cartoon version of this but I really enjoyed it. The characters are really good and the lead actor is great, lots of enthusiasm and energy from him. Yes it is a little cringe here and there but considering this is a adaption from a anime show I would assume they have stuck to the theme pretty tight. It starts out with a young boy dreaming of being a pirate. As the story goes on he picks up members of his crew and some back story's for them. I really love it but I can't imagine my wife sitting down and enjoying it so it's not for everyone. Really pleased to see there is going to be a second season!

Just lighten up and give it a try is all I say.",01-Oct-23,9.0,wasnt sold adverts back ground noise must admit fan binged watched day never watched cartoon version really enjoyed characters really good lead actor great lots enthusiasm energy yes little cringe considering adaption anime show would assume stuck theme pretty tight starts young boy dreaming pirate story goes picks members crew back storys really love cant imagine wife sitting enjoying everyone really pleased see going second season lighten give try say
"The ones who like this are full of die hard nostalgia, or have never seen one piece","I'll start by saying I'm not even opposed to a live action adaptation, it can totally be fine with proper creative direction. This did not have that.

There's so many aspects to this adaptation that were changed arbitrarily, for no reason, and it suffocates the 'one piece' feeling. At times, how the characters talk and act are super cringe, and at others they're serious when they shouldn't be. Tons of people praise this for taking a more serious tone, but then dialogue and line delivery are so unrealistic and goofy. This includes fairly graphic violence at times, which in no way fits the tone of scenes directly adjacent to it.

Much of the main characters have strayed from their anime personas, in particular Buggy is so far from his anime mannerisms, to the point where my favorite idiotic clown has become a serious loser. Usopp is nothing like his original self, acting weirdly cool and reserved without his over the top cowardice, which was a pinnacle of his character (not to mention no more ""long nose"" jokes which were killer in the anime)

The cinematography is too amateurish, if they wanted a more professional tone they should've prioritized it in their filming and fight choreography. This goes for the costume design and casting as well (no hate to the actors).

Overall, this live action's faults are completely characterized by a lack of vision or commitment to what it wants. I genuinely believe the only ones who appreciate this have not seen one piece or are so consumed with nostalgia they are blinded to the shortcomings this adaptation beholds.",10-Sep-23,2.0,ill start saying im even opposed live action adaptation totally fine proper creative direction theres many aspects adaptation changed arbitrarily reason suffocates one piece feeling times characters talk act super cringe others theyre serious shouldnt tons people praise taking serious tone dialogue line delivery unrealistic goofy includes fairly graphic violence times way fits tone scenes directly adjacent much main characters strayed anime personas particular buggy far anime mannerisms point favorite idiotic clown become serious loser usopp nothing like original self acting weirdly cool reserved without top cowardice pinnacle character mention long nose jokes killer anime cinematography amateurish wanted professional tone shouldve prioritized filming fight choreography goes costume design casting well hate actors overall live actions faults completely characterized lack vision commitment wants genuinely believe ones appreciate seen one piece consumed nostalgia blinded shortcomings adaptation beholds
"I didn't expect much, but I absolutely love it.","I admit, when I write reviews it's usually when something is so dreadful it makes me genuinely upset. I should take the time to write more positive reviews when something is deserving.

I am a fan of anime and manga, but this one somehow escaped my notice until now, so I'll have to go back to the source material after this series.

Everything about this show is endearing and fun. It's exciting at times, silly even more often, heartwarming just as often. I have nothing negative to say. The cast is great all around, and the actor who plays Luffy is just painfully lovable through and through. Moreover, it's a great family show to be enjoyed by tweens and oldies alike.

Netflix has had a lot of big misses the past few years, but this one shows they can still put out some great content. Well done.

"Well acted clich√©s, and wonderful manga-styled crazyness","(This review is coming from someone who has not seen the manga or read any comic books)

Season 1 is as much a journey through the East Blue as it is a journey through an amazing cast. Monkey D. Luffy, our main protagonist, dreams of becoming King of the Pirates. For this he needs a crew, and a boat, and throughout the season we follow him along as he meets up with more and more characters. More than 1 villain too. Everyone with their own dreams, or their own evil agenda. Luffy himself is a bit weird and naive, overly optimistic and good to a fault, and that - along with his rather formidable superpower to bend and stretch - is just the right combination of good and powerful to recruit some of the best pirates out there. And by best, we mean ""good"". It's time pirates starting acting a little nicer, don't you think?. The story is told in a linear fashion, and utilizes character flashbacks to great effect for both character depth and story arcs in present time.

Minor criticism: The story is perhaps a tad bit thin at first, with the plot primarily being moved forward by Luffy and his dream of being a great pirate, and some minor seemingly random events that needs to happen for him to meet more people and get a ship to pursue his dream. But I' not really criticizing this, merely mentioning it, as I'm probably not the only one heavily conditioned by typical tv shows to expect a great big injustice that needs redemption, or a great evil that threatens the whole world which must be stopped. But those elements do come with it's perks of drawing in the viewer, and this shows start very light on that front, and is instead character driven. Nothing wrong with that! AT ALL. But it means it will take some time for the show and the characters to grow on you.

There are plenty of bad guys though, but they pop in and out as beautifully extravagant freak shows that functions more as speed bumbs for the main story progression, and as a way to showcase some perfectly decent choreographed fight scenes. The only

The clich√©s are both amazing and a small drawback. There are some, at times, very on the nose story arcs for some of the main characters. This is a drawback because it feels like you have seen it before, and takes away the guesswork. You'll predict most of the outcomes before they happen. But the upside? Clich√©s are clich√©s for a reason. When done right, well written and acted, the result can be very powerful and captivating. And One Piece does them very well.

The great: I find every single main and supporting character in this show to be pretty darn amazing, both acting wise, but also style-wize. This IS based on a manga after all, where you can expect stereotypes to be very loudly portraited. It is not often you see these kinds of character translate as well into live action as some of the performances from the cast manages to do in One Piece (and I don't even have the built in forgiveness of someone who has seen the original). It is over-the-top manga-styled madness, but through character story-telling and good writing, it remains heartfelt and grounded at the same time. All actors bring uniqueness to their characters that they then stay true and consistent to. All (good) characters are very different, but also very likeable. A true ensemble of character fun, and glory.

Summary: Its a character driven show, packed with plenty of japanese manga-styled fun, with a larger than life message to follow your dreams - that take its time to draw you in with little to no intrigue. Give it a few episodes and allow the characters to be built up even further, and there is tons of charm and fun in this for most I dare say. The somewhat loose story plot does tighten in towards the end of the season, with a impactful and satisfying finale. It leaves you feeling excited for the characters, and their journey to come. And you'll probably want to join, when the next season comes.

"Thank you for heading this, Oda!","Fun fact: Eiichiro Oda, the creator of the manga One Piece, was very strict with the developers of this show over how it was going to pan out. It's obvious that certain Americanized story elements were put in for audiences in the US, but the honest truth is that the show is as faithful as a One Piece fan demands otherwise.

I recall the mid-2000's Peter Pan, which used intentionally cheesy lyrics in a charming way. This show kind of does the same thing, albeit with better effects than the movie, but still. This way, we get the cartoony behavior of the show at full force. And the best part is that the cast gets into their characters very easily, especially on the part of I√±aki Godoy. The show gets a lot of the best story elements right while condensing full arcs in very dramatic ways fit for the eight episode the show lasts. I especially love all the new touches they make with a couple of the minor characters, turning them into major characters with a lot of good delivery. Although, there are many key characters and brilliant scenes missing, so there is that level of disappointment for anyone who's easily seen a good deal of the original One Piece.

I'm watching the original show again in prep for season two, and partly because I want to further pic apart season one.

Every main character here has multiple reasons why they act and do what they do. Story is about friendship. Every character actually matters, and have their set of skills and personal properties.

So this suprised me i have never read or seen the anime.

To the adaptation: It seems to be alot for soul and love from both the writers, director and actors to adapt this.

It makes me wonder why could not Netflix have shown the same love to The Withcer?.

Anyway good show, fun and entertaining.",25-Sep-23,10.0,finally show character development show fun suprising character moments compare latest marvel star wars show see far disney fallen every main character multiple reasons act story friendship every character actually matters set skills personal properties suprised never read seen anime adaptation seems alot soul love writers director actors adapt makes wonder could netflix shown love withcer anyway good show fun entertaining
A Heartfelt Martial-Artsy Ode To The Original - Season 1 Review,"Bringing the manga to life is one thing, but living up the hit anime series which started in 1999 and is still going, that's something else.

Beautiful back-stories, diverse casting, well-paced character arcs, and a few creative tweaks here and there added to the overall captivation of ""One Piece"" season one.

Every performance was on point, especially the core characters - Monkey D. Luffy (played by I√±aki Godoy), Roronoa Zoro (played by Mackenyu; son of famed actor and martial artist Sonny Chiba), Koby (played by Morgan Davies), Sanji (played by Taz Skylar), Usopp (played by Jacob Romero), and Nami (played by Emily Rudd).

The stunts and VFX were spot on. It felt like watching a photorealistic version of the manga and anime combined. The sheer challenge of achieving this can't be stressed enough.

Every fan worth their sea salt knows this next part. This is a story about a bunch of pirates who aimed to grab the greatest loot of all, the titular 'one piece'. This so-called treasure was hidden away by the pirate king Gold Roger himself, more than two decades before he was publicly executed (in Loguetown).

The pirate age was still sailing strong, but his treasure was almost impossible to find. This only added to its worth and made it a significant target worth every risk. And so, crazy-quirky Monkey D. Luffy decided to make it worth his lifetime to get his name etched into pirate legend.

Standing against him were foes like Buggy (played by Jeff Ward), Ax-Hand Morgan (played by Langley Kirkwood), Klahadore/Kuro (played by Alexander Maniatis), Mihawk (played by Steven John Ward), Arlong (played by McKinley Belcher III), and Vice-Admiral Garp (Luffy's own grandfather, played by Vincent Regan).

Monkey's hilarity and confidence, Nami's empathy and cunning, Roronoa's martial arts and drive, Sanji's cooking and charm, Usopp's innocence and storytelling, and Koby's ambition and confliction made every scene they were in count.

Special shout-out to Aidan Scott (as Helmeppo), Peter Gadiot (as Shanks), Craig Fairbrass (as Zeff the Chef), and Chioma Antoinette Umeala (as Nojiko). The core characters' kid versions did superb work as well.

As much as the heroes delivered excellence, so too did all the villains in ""One Piece"" - mindful casting all round there. The ship designs - especially the goat-figureheaded ""Going Merry"" - were wowza too. The way they brought the Baratie ship-staurant to life was outstanding as well.

An old-school martial-arts-movie vibe blissfully blessed every episode, making the series captivating from start to finish without a single scene wasted. I distinctly felt 'Kung Fu Hustle' and 'Enter The Dragon' vibes in several instances.

This 'curse breaker' among anime adaptations took several creative risks and they all paid off. The action-adventure fantasy was filled with elements of hope, purpose, glory, betrayal, romance, friendship, love, loyalty, and piracy galore.

I enjoyed watching all eight episodes of this remarkable story featuring unique characters that have been defining cosplay and pop culture for years.

As an adaptation of a hit anime, this one proved its worth and mettle by evoking that all-too-elusive fan sentiment which can only come from careful attention to plot layering, smart inclusion of lore, and dedication to character detailing.

All this made season 1 of ""One Piece"" a master-piece deserving of all the praise and admiration it has received, and will continue to do so (I'm sure) in the years to come.

An Objective Review,"I know the anime but never watched it. I did watch other anime adaptations and they're almost all bad. So I went to check this show with no high expectations at all.

It really surprised me. This show has heart, care and an outstanding production value. From the different characters to multiple scenarios, buildings, costumes and make-up.

I can only imagine how hard it is to balance an anime adaptation to live action without losing its anime essence for their fans and without making it annoying, childish and sometimes nonsense for the common audience. But they nailed it. It is very, very good.

I had an insane good time watching it. Good fights, likeable characters with awesome chemistry between them, creative story, fun laughs and I must admit, emotional tears.

I normally only comment when a show really pisses me off and I have to vent it somewhere. But with this show I felt the need to post a positive review because it really is an unique good anime adaptation and it really deserves it.",05-Sep-23,9.0,know anime never watched watch anime adaptations theyre almost bad went check show high expectations really surprised show heart care outstanding production value different characters multiple scenarios buildings costumes makeup imagine hard balance anime adaptation live action without losing anime essence fans without making annoying childish sometimes nonsense common audience nailed good insane good time watching good fights likeable characters awesome chemistry creative story fun laughs must admit emotional tears normally comment show really pisses vent somewhere show felt need post positive review really unique good anime adaptation really deserves
"I'm not a manga or anime fan, but I liked it...","I remember watching the first episodes of the anime when I was young, and the series here is about these episodes, It made me feel nostalgic for the past.

The series is like a remake of the original anime. I liked the cartoonish atmosphere, and the CGI was good.

The cast is nice; I liked most of it. Their acting was good most of the time. The way events were narrated was nice by integrating the events with the backstories of the characters; I loved Luffy, Nami and Zoro's backstories.

The scenario is fast and misses a lot of details from the manga and anime as I understood it, but I liked that it always keeps you attentive to the events.

Some places feel exactly like an anime, and most of the fights have a cartoonish character, but the general atmosphere is a comical One Piece atmosphere that will keep you anticipating what will happen.

Delightful Wholesome Fun,"I tried to get into the anime before, just to see why it's so popular, but by then there were just too many episodes to get through so I didn't bother anymore.

I'm also not that into anime, although I can watch a bit here & there (movie/short series), but very picky and definitely not going to invest that much time in one with over hundreds of episodes.

I'm also over the fantasy genre in movies. I just mostly get bored. But this... I'm surprised I enjoyed this live action a lot!

At first I thought it was going to be cringey for me. There were some cheesy parts, but I was surprised I actually couldn't stop watching!

Excellent world-building, the characters are spot on. Heartwarming, inspirational, entertaining throughout.

Almost; good start to begin though,"One Piece live action almost hit the mark, but trips over on its own wit: serie tries to offer something for everybody and every audience. And this is its weakness.

Examples: Core enough of older audience - light themes for younger.

Something for new OP audience - something for existing fans.

Tries to be live action realistic - tries not to be too much.

.... .. When serie tries to please everyone, it can't hit the mark perfectly on any area.

Some key GOOD and BAD things to point out:

GOOD
Casting is perfectly done
World, filming set, locations looks great
Cinematograhy


BAD
Screenplay. Story is rushed, and doesn't build up to make emotions strong enough to hold the viewer on hook. Original manga's story is amazing made, and unfortunately live action's is too rushed.



Wardrobe. Even though, live action tries not to look as characters are cosplaying, their clothes just look..off. Fabrics look cheap and clothes overall doesnt look like they belong to world. They indeed look like cosplay.



Action scenes. Fights bring nothing cool or exciting to audience, and are slow paced, which push away from world of One Piece.


SUMMARY Really good start for the serie.

Hopefully first season is log pose for better Season 2 where most of faulses are being fixed.

What is the big deal?,"Corny, boring, the actors don't care about their parts, or show any real interest in the show itself. I saw the first episode and after a while I started seeing the same thing over and over again, just the way the actors liked to pose for the camera, then depend on the special effects to make the show popular. Not to mention the way the characters look like they're cosplaying in their backyard and hosting a kid's show or something like ""bear in the big blue house"" especially when it comes to arlong. Believe me I don't know HOW this got so popular, or so much hype, but if you call it ""bad"" you're labeled the bad guy? I don't know, all I can say is EVEN Luffy doesn't punch like a girl with her thumbs up, and the way you can easily see the suspension strings on that actors should also tell you what to say about your ""special effects"" also, if you're praising THIS as a good LIVE action, then stop being so hard on the past live actions, because at least those guys tried, I mean c'mon, glue on hair, mustache, and foam swords, and then make arlong as short as Luffy?",03-Sep-23,1.0,corny boring actors dont care parts show real interest show saw first episode started seeing thing way actors liked pose camera depend special effects make show popular mention way characters look like theyre cosplaying backyard hosting kids show something like bear big blue house especially comes arlong believe dont know got popular much hype call bad youre labeled bad guy dont know say even luffy doesnt punch like girl thumbs way easily see suspension strings actors also tell say special effects also youre praising good live action stop hard past live actions least guys tried mean cmon glue hair mustache foam swords make arlong short luffy
Yo Row Heave Ho,"In Netflix's highly anticipated live-action adaptation of Eiichiro Oda's iconic manga, ""One Piece,"" viewers are treated to an eight-episode spectacle. With I√±aki Godoy donning the hat as the fearless Monkey D. Luffy, Mackenyu takes up the swordsman's mantle as Roronoa Zoro, while Emily Rudd becomes the charming Nami, Jacob Romero transforms into the imaginative Usopp, and Taz Skylar embodies the suave and skilled Sanji.

This thrilling series follows the young adventurer Luffy as he embarks on a treacherous journey, driven by an unwavering desire to uncover the legendary treasure known as One Piece. The ultimate goal? To claim the title of King of the Pirates, making for an epic and riveting tale that promises to captivate both fans of the manga and newcomers alike.

While previous attempts at live-action adaptations, such as Cowboy Bebop and Death Note, have left fans wanting, One Piece steps into the ring with a mixed bag of successes and challenges that are not uncommon in the Netflix production landscape. The series occasionally grapples with uneven pacing and a tendency to tread cautiously around its audacious concepts. However, at its core, One Piece recognizes that the true allure of this perilous odyssey lies in the depth of its characters, and I√±aki Godoy's portrayal of the relentlessly optimistic Monkey D. Luffy shines as a beacon in the East Blue.

Despite the occasional pacing hiccups, the production dazzles with enchanting performances, remarkable action sequences, and a captivating quest set in a world brimming with pirates. One Piece emerges as an adaptation teeming with untapped potential. Netflix appears to grasp the vast wellspring of source material at their disposal, and if subsequent installments maintain the charm of this inaugural season, Luffy may eventually ascend to the status of a legendary hero.

Eiichiro Oda's enduring masterpiece continues to evolve through the release of new manga volumes, offering a rich narrative tapestry for adaptation. This implies that if Netflix's experiment with One Piece continues to yield success, it could burgeon into an indelible franchise. However, building something of such grandeur requires a sturdy foundation. Thankfully, the first season of this odyssey across the East Blue proves to be a lively, explosive, and emotionally resonant experience, mirroring the youthful vibrancy of its charismatic protagonist. The future remains uncertain for Luffy and his comrades, but for now, the sun shines brightly on One Piece.",06-Sep-23,8.0,netflixs highly anticipated liveaction adaptation eiichiro odas iconic manga one piece viewers treated eightepisode spectacle iaki godoy donning hat fearless monkey luffy mackenyu takes swordsmans mantle roronoa zoro emily rudd becomes charming nami jacob romero transforms imaginative usopp taz skylar embodies suave skilled sanji thrilling series follows young adventurer luffy embarks treacherous journey driven unwavering desire uncover legendary treasure known one piece ultimate goal claim title king pirates making epic riveting tale promises captivate fans manga newcomers alike previous attempts liveaction adaptations cowboy bebop death note left fans wanting one piece steps ring mixed bag successes challenges uncommon netflix production landscape series occasionally grapples uneven pacing tendency tread cautiously around audacious concepts however core one piece recognizes true allure perilous odyssey lies depth characters iaki godoys portrayal relentlessly optimistic monkey luffy shines beacon east blue despite occasional pacing hiccups production dazzles enchanting performances remarkable action sequences captivating quest set world brimming pirates one piece emerges adaptation teeming untapped potential netflix appears grasp vast wellspring source material disposal subsequent installments maintain charm inaugural season luffy may eventually ascend status legendary hero eiichiro odas enduring masterpiece continues evolve release new manga volumes offering rich narrative tapestry adaptation implies netflixs experiment one piece continues yield success could burgeon indelible franchise however building something grandeur requires sturdy foundation thankfully first season odyssey across east blue proves lively explosive emotionally resonant experience mirroring youthful vibrancy charismatic protagonist future remains uncertain luffy comrades sun shines brightly one piece
I didn't love it but don't hate it... completely,It was nothing like the anime and it made me angry. They made Luffy eating the fruit really dramatic for some reason. Like it was super magical and mistical and stuff I found that really weird considering the anime where he was in a bar as like a seven year old. And NAMI showed up to help Zoro!! That's my main problem with it. That made me really not like it. And what's up with the safe there was never a safe!!!! Captain buggy was supposed to have the grand line map!!!! Originally Luffy was just stupid but now he's stupid and annoying so that's helpful. And why does Zoro walk up to everything!!! On the other hand the costume and set are really well done. Especially Captain buggys design. Love his designs. But then again he's supposed to be on a roof shooting cannon balls into the town not in some circus tent. The thing that's doing it for me is mostly the sets and costumes.,10-Sep-23,5.0,nothing like anime made angry made luffy eating fruit really dramatic reason like super magical mistical stuff found really weird considering anime bar like seven year old nami showed help zoro thats main problem made really like whats safe never safe captain buggy supposed grand line map originally luffy stupid hes stupid annoying thats helpful zoro walk everything hand costume set really well done especially captain buggys design love designs hes supposed roof shooting cannon balls town circus tent thing thats mostly sets costumes
Don't be fooled,"I'm truly avoiding writing anythong about new movies and series, just because netfreaks, derpney and such keep ruinnig everything they manage to touch.

I'm a fan of One Piece, and as soon as I saw netfreak announcing a live action, I knew they would ruin it.

And they did.

I know tha a live action of a anime, or any cartoon, just cannot be equal, for a million reasons.

But with all the money netfreaks have, One Piece should be A LOT better.

And, of course, should have been better in casting, special effects and specially the writing... Unluckly, as always, it sucks.

But, on the other hand - luckly - we all seen worst.

I'm not hoping for another season, but if netfreaks decide to do a second, maybe they'll put some more effort on it.

About the live action per se: if you already know the anime, watch it with your hopes down.

If you do not know, watch it and go for the anime. You will be surprised.

The actors try, but do not deliver.

The writing sucks.

Some effects are good, and some are just bleargh.

A great Adaptation,"This is a lighthearted *Netflix* live action adoptation of one of the most popular and legendary manga source material written by Eiichir√¥ Oda abridged in just 8 eps.

The original manga has 105 volumes which is converted into an anime with 1084 eps.

The fantasy action drama is about a sweet talking righteous heroic young straw-hat-pirate (played by a charismatic Mexican actor) who is assembling his loyal pirate crew to find a treasure in a world of oceans and phantasy islands to become the King of all Pirates.

On this journey they have to fight different warlords, often with special powers, a bit like the 2010 comic book adaptation *Scott Pilgrim vs. The World*.

It's a fun adventure story with an entertaining plot, great cast, well developed characters, costumes and movie quality set design.

It scores 8.5 on IMDb and 83% on rotten tomatoes.

It's a visually pleasing and sometimes violent alternative to Disney's Peter Pan:

Why is this rated only 8.5,"This adaptation is love letter to One piece anime. This is how you do live adaption, or maybe this is how you do it for rest of the world who didn't grew up watching anime and getting around clich√©s and quirks of it.

It pays respect to it's roots. The show is faithful to manga, witty, quirky and right amount of everything but especially for western audience.

It has gore, it didn't butcher character concepts, actually, I can't believe how actors portrait them so well. And best of all, production is isn't cheap.

This is so good it's a, crime and I want to see it more coming (and by the looks of it, they would be crazy not to, since it broke streaming records set by ST or Wednesdays)

A One Piece Live Action Review - By a One Piece Animanga Enjoyer,"I began the show skeptical, and was pleasantly surprised.

I wouldn't call it perfection like some ratings imply, but it kept my attention the whole way through and has me looking forward for season 2 ~ You can expect the live action to take quite a few liberties in regard to differentiating itself from the animanga, and I'm not mad about it at all. Most of the important call-backs to the anime are there, and a lot of what they changed breaths fresh air into the series. Rather than being a copy paste, It's creating a unique experience that is unique on to itself. For One Piece fans, that's more One Piece content (not that we are short on One Piece content)

The casting is 90% spot on and 10% what on earth were they thinking!! (hah). Seriously though some of the casting was very good.

It's not going to look like 2024 mission impossible coming to theatres near you, but if you can look past the blemishes, there is something left there to be thoroughly enjoyed.

The acting was decent with some room for improvement, Luffy being a bit uncharacteristic at times and questionable delivery of certain lines are probably some of my bigger gripes.

The props looked good (especially the Baratie), the fishmen looked great, everything looked a lot cleaner than the sneak peak we had got before release. The CGI for Luffy looks a little odd ngl but other things like the sea beast looked spot on.

They change some character ethnicities which I don't really mind, but in cases where it feels politically motivated (they do this to everything now-a-days) it comes at the expense of the original character designs which I don't like the trade off.

The prevalent dynamic between Koby and Luffy for the live action was great, Buggy and Garp were stand out roles that they changed quite a bit of the story for them.

There wasn't a point while watching where I got bored, it struck a balance revisiting something that I know and love and something that is brand new. They did a great job 'cutting the fat', taking a lot of the good ideas from One Piece and stacking them in a way that made for a potent live action series.

Rating: 72/100. ----- Worth Checking Out!

~ To any of the people who have only watched the live action, I would encourage you to check out the anime! It's one of the greatest pieces of fiction of all time. Don't be intimidated by the length of the show by the end you will be saying it needs another 1000 episodes!

"I was really surprised. Good choice of actors, nice sets and a cool adaption of the anime. I hope for a second season","Netflix had the heavy task of producing a Live Action on a deeply cartoonish universe as a whole. It is not a question of making superheroes in a realistic universe but of recreating the entire fantastic universe of One Piece (islands, boats, fish men, with secondary or iconic characters with a very particular style).

Another difficulty was being able to keep the spirit of the manga with 5 times less viewing time. This is precisely where the term rehabilitation takes on its full meaning.

By reorganizing the events as they did they were able to summarize 96 chapters in only 8 episodes without the mechanics of time acceleration (5 days later, etc.) while being fluid in the narration and preserving the story as that we know her.

Some modifications are even welcome for the series. The presence of Nami earlier and the fact that she knows how to fight from the start, the fact that Luffy witnesses Zoro's behavior towards the little girl from the bar, the death of Merry who is more coherent in the face of the injury than he undergoes.

I was also surprised by certain actors who were able to enhance their characters as is the case with Usopp and Hermep.

Really enjoyed it!,"One of the most highly anticipated shows (or feared, if you watch anime and have borne the brunt of the live-action disappointments) has dropped. The Pirates have come. One Piece is here, #1 in 84 countries, beating out Stranger Things and Wednesday. 8.5, 83%, 95%, 4.5 scores so far.

Let me get this out of the way first: Yes, it's AMAZING! Yes, you have got to watch it! No, you don't have to know anything about the manga/anime to watch this show.

Netflix took a huge gamble in adapting one of the G. O. A. T. anime, hugely popular over 20 yrs to a format that has received criticism for the most part, with no big stars, reportedly spent ~ $18M/episode (higher than the likes of Game of Thrones, The Mandalorian) and I have to say, One Piece might have just broken the curse.

I'd chosen to stay away from the 1000+ episodic run, I knew I'd get sucked in and nothing else with my life, but this 8-ep run was a chance I couldn't miss - especially after RAVE reviews from the purists.

The show, I understand, covers about 95 chapters/45 episodes in 8 live-action episodes. It is stunningly shot. Brilliant writing (I'm sure 20 years of source material must help, but it could have gone horribly wrong) Brilliant acting by everybody seemingly new. The show is quirky, goofy, action-packed, wholesome.

Cast,The storyline is impressive but the casting of side character is really poor. Netflix really neet to get a better cast for the side character some of the main character are also not that much impressive and they are trying to fit in with the role but not that much sucessful. For the second season they really need to get a better cast for the side characters. This will improve the story and provide it a better base to set the story line for the upcoming adventure of luffy and his crew or I can say the straw hat pirates.

"A legitimately good live-action adaptation with a lot of heart, respect to the source material, and surprisingly pleasant changes","I loved this live action adaptation. As a TV show, I'd give it an 8/10, but seeing the heart and passion that went into this, as well as it going to be, without a doubt, groundbreaking in terms of being the first GREAT Hollywood-produced live action anime adaptation tv show, I gotta bump the score to a 9/10.

First off I want to say hats off to the production crew and set builders. The overall design is insanely good. I already knew they built many of their sets but I still was blown away by the sheer scale and quality of everything. Aside from a few obvious green screened environments and shots, everything looked top notch.

Many of the fights are well choreographed and fun to watch. Some fights could be a little too ""unserious"" and have a bit much ""wire-fu"" for my taste. None of the fights were bad. Some were too short imo, but not bad.

These actors/actress ARE the straw hat crew, no doubt about it. They came and did their best. Because I'm biased towards the anime/manga, I wished some of them would nail some of their character's more emotional notes a bit better with a ""DON!"" (as a certain fisherman would say), but hey you can't beat the originals. They weren't bad at all and I believe most non-fans of One Piece without context or prior knowledge could still be convinced by their acting.

Most comedic moments are actually funny. The comedy is actually GOOD and naturally occurring. Although not all jokes landed for me, none felt forced or cringey imo. It especially works for the overall tone this adaptation is going for.

Many of the changes that were made to the plot did speed up the pacing, but it never felt super rushed. Every new plot line and character introduction felt smooth and natural. Not every long-time fan is going to like these changes, especially to some existing characters, but trust me when I say these changes work in the context of this live action adaption.

My favorite things about this adaptation has got to be the crew dynamic. It's so real and you feel their relationships building organically throughout the season.

Also, live action Buggy > anime/manga Buggy. No, I will not elaborate.

Overall, I agree with Oda's statement saying that this adaptation ain't perfect and there are some things that could have been better. But damn does this adaptation have heart. This whole thing was written by, made by, acted by, and guided by true One Piece fans. I'm just glad that this not only exists, but I'm also happy to say that it's legitimately good. I can't speak from the perspective of a newcomer to the series, but from a biased perspective of a 14-year long time fan, this is great.

I was wrong,"I always believed that when I make a mistake, the best way to approach it, is to admit that I made a mistake.

And I am doing so now.

I have a marginal knowledge of the anime. Saw some episodes, know some of the characters and generally I liked it. I have no knowledge of the manga series except for knowing that it exists.

But when the announcement of the live adaptation came, with Netflix behind it, I was doubtful to say the least. Trailer didn't really peaked my interest, cast was unknown to me and to be honest Netflix doesn't have the greatest track record (Witcher, Cowboy Bebop...).

But I thought to my self ""Alright, let's give this a chance."" and with still rather low expectations I watched the first episode... and then second and so on.

And I have enjoyed it! I must say that I have genuinely enjoyed this show's first season. There were few things that didn't really fit me, namely the CGI was ""limping"" a bit sometimes.

Pace is fast, jokes are, characters almost fit their anime counterparts (as best as possible), environments, backstories... A fresh wind in my old sails.

So once more I admit my mistake for having so low expectations, because this is really great.

And I am looking forward to second season.",07-Sep-23,9.0,always believed make mistake best way approach admit made mistake marginal knowledge anime saw episodes know characters generally liked knowledge manga series except knowing exists announcement live adaptation came netflix behind doubtful say least trailer didnt really peaked interest cast unknown honest netflix doesnt greatest track record witcher cowboy bebop thought self alright lets give chance still rather low expectations watched first episode second enjoyed must say genuinely enjoyed shows first season things didnt really fit namely cgi limping bit sometimes pace fast jokes characters almost fit anime counterparts best possible environments backstories fresh wind old sails admit mistake low expectations really great looking forward second season
3rd times is the charm for Netflix,"One Piece is one of my favourite manga. I was genuinely flabbergasted when I heard that there was going to be a live-action adaptation of this. One Piece is a very weird and wacky world that I just don't believe could be brought accurately into live-action. Additionally, Netflix was going to make it and they have failed miserably with manga/anime live-action adaptations. Death Note completely butchered the characters and was not a faithful story. Cowboy Bebop had none of the charm of the anime with terrible writing and also not a faithful story. My expectations for this were at an all-time low but the creator of One Piece, Oda, was involved in this project. So maybe 3rd time is the charm?

The first thing I noticed from the first couple of episodes, was the stunning set designs and costumes. I was surprised at the amount of practical sets that felt like great replications of places in the source material. The iconic ship, The Going Merry, looks 1 to 1 exactly like it does in the manga and it looks beautiful! CGI is implemented to further bring the world to life but it is never overused or bad to look at. The characters look exactly like the source material from their clothes to their hair. They use practical make-up and prosthetics for non-human characters and they look great! The action scenes are also very well choreographed while having no shaky camera which is awesome! Nami, Zoro and Sanji have such terrific fight scenes. I was worried about how they would do Luffy's rubber powers in live action but it is done very well. The music score by Sonya and Giona is terrific. They created a score that really gives off the adventure and pirate feeling. They also do an awesome cover of the iconic opening ""We Are"" as well.

On that note, the casting of the Straw Hats is perfect. Inaki Godoy captures the optimism and silliness of Luffy without feeling cringy. Emily Rudd, Mackenyu, Jacob Romero Gibson and Taz Skylar manage to bring the core personalities of their characters Nami, Zoro, Usopp and Sanji to live action respectfully. For example, Nami still has her flirty scenes to trick people and Sanji still has the flirty treatment with women albeit no longer bothering them which is an understandable change. The villains are also well cast with each of them pulling off the character in live action phenomenally. The great highlight is Jeff Ward as Buggy who somehow manages to be incredibly scary yet silly which is exactly who Buggy is.

One of the biggest reasons for the failure of previous adaptations by Netflix is the butchering of the story. I can thankfully say that this is not the case in One Piece (2023). The main core of each story is still here and the iconic moments are replicated here as well. It was awesome seeing the moments I loved in the anime being done here in the same manner. The adventurous and fun yet violent nature of One Piece is still retained here. There are changes to the story which is understandable because they need to put the story in an 8-hour series. For example, they removed side characters like Johnny, Yosaku and Jango or changed how fights are resolved and how arcs end. Nonetheless, these changes don't hurt the series and it is quite impressive that they managed to still tell the same story. The tone of the show is a bit more serious than the source material but this is also understandable. Manga and Anime are different types of media than a live-action TV show. Not everything can be brought to live-action without coming off as weird but the showrunners understood that and struck a good balance between serious and wacky fun without leaning too hard in either direction.

There are some bigger changes in the story such as introducing the character of Garp very early and having Arlong as the villain in Baratie arc instead of Kreig. I am kind of mixed on these changes as I do understand why but they also create some problems. The introduction of Garp who is chasing Luffy is done to create some tension and stakes for the characters that would be present for the whole series. It was also done to give perspective for the Marines in the form of Koby who has a bigger role in this series compared to the source material. Garp comes off as more scary than he normally is, to the point that he almost feels nothing like Garp should be at times. His character has weird tantrums that feel a bit odd as well. The subplot of the marines also ends up taking a lot of screen time from the main plot which leads to the main story feeling short at times. Arlong's early introduction was also done to hype him up as the big bad of the series. The problem is that the Baratie arc is meant to be focused on Sanji but he ends up feeling overshadowed in his arc by Zoro and Nami who are now more focused. Sanji's decision to leave and join Luffy isn't as well built up because of this change. The creators did very well with the 2 episode limit per arc but the Baratie arc suffered the most.

Overall, I honestly can't believe that the one I thought would be the most unadaptable, ended up being the best adaptation Netflix has done so far. They managed to accurately bring the world of One Piece to live action, which is quite an achievement. It seems Netflix has finally learnt from their mistakes and started respecting the source material. Them bringing in the creator to be more involved seems to have also paid off.

Really good and fun,"This is from the perspective of someone that never read the manga or watched the anime. I was surprised at how good this adaptation is.

Usually live action versions of famous manga or anime are underwhelming. But not this one. The cast is perfectly chosen, and it is clear that the series is made with enough resources, talented people behind the cameras and writing the script, and there is love for the original manga. And a minor extra point: the action scenes are well choreographed and the actors are good with physical fights. All these ingredients contribute to a final outstanding product.

Welp. Guess I gotta read the manga now.,"Let's start by saying I have *nothing* against manga. I enjoy it, more darker stuff usually, but I enjoy it. I've never dove into the One Piece series nor had the desire to. After hearing this premier to rave reviews and be called ""the greatest manga adaptation"" I knew I had to watch it. So I started it. And was hooked by the end of episode one. Did I leave my couch after starting it? That's none of your concern. But did I enjoy the absolute heck out of it? Yes. Yes I did. It was entertaining. Goofy. Serious. Heartwarming. Heartwrenching. And so. Much. Fun. I didn't think I would enjoy a story about pirates but I did. I rank this up with the Queens Gambit in lines of storytelling, care put into the production, care of the characters and the sincerity with the application onto the screen.

Most faithful.,This is an abridged one piece esque version in the true spirit of the original. The most faithful live action adaptation i've ever seen of anything. They really stripped one piece down to its bare bones and focused on the main thread. Staying true to the core essence of what one piece was all about. As a true one piece fan. I believe this is a beautiful and amazing addition to the legacy that oda has given us. I am a slave to comparison so for me this version is near perfect. But that's a damn sight closer than any version of any anime has ever gotten before. A true stand out series in every way. Each actor is an embodiment of the character.

IM SO HAPPY ABOUT THIS,"I'm actually ecstatic with how they went about this, I'm 31 and I grew up watching this show.

This show effortlessly hops in between happy go lucky to straight up traumatic so be careful letting your kids watch it, it can get pretty dark.

All in all, I have to say this is one of, if not the best live anime adaptation I've ever seen so far. Bravo to everybody who worked on this, You pulled it off perfectly.

They nailed it,"It is probably the best live action adaptation I have watched so far. The story is good, the VFX are great, fights are awesome and the acting feels natural. They really stand truth to the fans, and modified the story in a way that feels natural. After all this is a teleplay, is not anime. They adapted everything.

I gave the live action this rate, because of the directing. They used too many wide shots, and low angles for the close ups. Many close up shots felt kind of weird... as if they were crazy or on drugs at a party. For Buggy these are the perfect shots because the character dictates everything, but not for everyone.

Buuuut... when making a movie or TV series is not about making the best piece of art, but the best art under the given circumstances. And they had a lot of circumstances in my opinion.",31-Aug-23,8.0,probably best live action adaptation watched far story good vfx great fights awesome acting feels natural really stand truth fans modified story way feels natural teleplay anime adapted everything gave live action rate directing used many wide shots low angles close ups many close shots felt kind weird crazy drugs party buggy perfect shots character dictates everything everyone buuuut making movie tv series making best piece art best art given circumstances lot circumstances opinion
One Piece Translated Well,"The show covers roughly the first 44 episodes of the anime over the span of 8 one hour episodes. Honestly, I expected it to be awful. I was hesitantly pleased with the casting choices, and the preview footage shown by Netflix.

This show is a great introduction to the universe for new fans, and a very fun watch for longtime fans. The cgi is good in most aspects, the costumes, while goofy, are accurate. Some of the acting is a bit flat unfortunately, particularly Nami (and maybe that's a choice for the character to grow from) and Mihawk. However the fast pace of the show never lets it linger on any of the poorer parts, and for the best. 90% of the show's production, direction, and acting is great, not Oscar worthy, but enjoyable and binge watchable.

In season 2, I'd like to see more expression from the actors, some longer lines of dialogue, and the same quality of action, cgi, and pacing that this first season kept.

After Death Note, Fullmetal, Sandman, and Cowboy Bebop, I was not in the mood for another 2d to live action show. But this one is finally worth it! Perhaps the formula going forward for Netflix is this: keeping the classiness and design of manga panels, producing it well, and including the most relevant parts of the story.",02-Sep-23,8.0,show covers roughly first episodes anime span one hour episodes honestly expected awful hesitantly pleased casting choices preview footage shown netflix show great introduction universe new fans fun watch longtime fans cgi good aspects costumes goofy accurate acting bit flat unfortunately particularly nami maybe thats choice character grow mihawk however fast pace show never lets linger poorer parts best shows production direction acting great oscar worthy enjoyable binge watchable season id like see expression actors longer lines dialogue quality action cgi pacing first season kept death note fullmetal sandman cowboy bebop mood another live action show one finally worth perhaps formula going forward netflix keeping classiness design manga panels producing well including relevant parts story
"Succesful adapation, enjoyable to watch but has some bad directing.","This is from the perspective of the anime watcher. Cast well. Especially the clown Buggy and Luffy. The world is faitful to the original as in characters have horns, weird hair and so on. The tempo is condensed and the story goes forward way way faster than in the anime. The action is mostly good with some oddities as in sometimes things just feel off. Mostly it feels good but has bad directing. Things just sometimes feel off. Some takes feel off and some interactions feel off. There is no tension building anywhere. Missed opportunities everywhere. The series is like a well furnished room where some of the colors don't work well together. I don't think I have ever felt this effect this strongly watching anything. With small adjustment to editing and directing this could be 9/10.

Real life Monkey D Luffy,"Honestly I don't think people really understand how hard it is to bring a character like Monkey D Luffy to live action. It was an actual privilege watching this series. Most of the anime episodes are about 20 minutes long, so watching them piece together these episodes and not feeling like you were missing something. This was a very good feeling. It's easy now to get on social media, Google or Wikipedia and find information about One Piece. I basically would recommend anybody who has any interest in the anime to watch this gem of a show. I was very pleased with the character development of each character in the time allowed. I'm just hoping they have already made at least three more seasons because in real life people get old quick.",09-Sep-23,10.0,honestly dont think people really understand hard bring character like monkey luffy live action actual privilege watching series anime episodes minutes long watching piece together episodes feeling like missing something good feeling easy get social media google wikipedia find information one piece basically would recommend anybody interest anime watch gem show pleased character development character time allowed im hoping already made least three seasons real life people get old quick
We need to be honest.,"As a fan of One Piece for more than 15 years, I was excited since the announcement of One Piece live action. I followed the cast, producers, fan pages etc. I watched the series with an open mind and positivity while I was keeping in mind that it simply can not be perfect, it's so difficult to adapt something like One Piece. The first 5 episodes were good, the sets were amazing, actors mostly did a solid job (outstanding performance from Buggy, Kuro, Mihawk, Sanji and Nami). I was very pleased so it was easier to not focus so much on problems like the obviously fake props (of course the props were supposed to be fake, but we shouldn't be able to see them so clearly. You can see Zoro's sword cases bend in some scenes for example), low-quality wigs that were poorly styled, unrealistic blood flow/color and some rough fighting scenes. But then, when the 6th episode started everything went downhill. The episode starts with everyone on the crew being worried that Zoro is losing too much blood, Meanwhile, there was 0 blood flow, I suppose they wanted to censor it but this felt very awkward and I didn't feel ""worried"" for Zoro's health. The emotional moments, unfortunately, felt flat, the acting and direction should be and could be better. The fight sequences in the last 3 episodes were horrible. I could clearly understand the use of ropes which made the whole thing look awkward, Arlong's (and fishmen) prosthetic art was rough, to say the least, which made them less believable. The final fight between Luffy and Arlong was one of the biggest disappointments in the series. Arlong did nothing, barely gave a couple of punches to Luffy, he did no damage, there was no stakes, no danger. My last straw was Nami's backstory and specifically Bellmere's death. It was soulless, emotionless. Bellmere and Nojiko didn't act, at all and they didn't even bother to include the scene that Bellmere puts her gun into Arlong's mouth and he just breaks the gun with his teeth (very easy to adapt this scene in Live action). I Love One Piece so my first score when I watched the first 5 episodes was a 7.5/10. After seeing the last three episodes, the show barely deserves a 6. I still want to see more seasons but things need to be improved. I am seeing thousands of fans giving this show a 10/10, I understand you love one piece and you want it renewed but we need to be HONEST because if we don't we will just get more mediocre seasons and they won't even bother to fix the missteps of the first season.

I really really solid adaptation.,"This is how they should have done bebop's adaptation. Just have a great cast and follow the original story, no more no less. First thing that really stands out is the cast, atleast judging by first episodes, they did great job with casting. Starting from Luffy who brings a great energy to the mix and really sells Luffy to me, to Zoro who is even a bigger bad ass in this then in the anime, and Nami who is so smooth and a great fighter. Even helmeppo and axe hand morgan do a great job and don't look silly at all. And Buggy is nightmare fuel, but it'll just be so much funnier when he uses his absurd devil fruit powers.

Other then that, the world is nicely done, with a mix of cgi and real world sets and places, the cgi is decent and makes the cartoony antics come to life, gum gum attacks don't look ridiculous. The choreography is above average for sure and fight scenes look solid.

And best of all it follows the story beats nicely, and is faithful the joy of fans of the story.

Strong Adaption,"I went in with low expectations. Several previous live action anime adaptions proved how hard it is create a worthy adaption. One can clearly see how much time and love was invested. I especially liked I√±aki Godoys performance. He managed to really be Luffy, without being weird (which must be hard while playing such an expressive character).

Moreover I liked the few changes that made the series differ from the anime. You should not expect a 1:1 adaption, which would be pointless anyway.

Surprisingly Entertaining but...,"The main cast is good and I can see why they were selected, but the Luffy character is clearly a heavily-accented Mexican and the many scenes of him as a child are played by an American boy with no accent and who doesn't appear to be Hispanic. I found this consistently distracting and a weakness in a mostly stellar production.

I was not a fan of the Manga, or really any Manga, so I did not expect to like this as much as I did.

After 36 Years on Earth I think I'll never get to see a decent Anime Adaptation,"Here me out, just hear me out. Anime was something which helped me to get through most of my childhood and adolescence. Was bullied in school a lot because of it. But I didn't care. I loved it so much that I started watching only anime at a point till high school. Apert from Dragon Ball Z, One Piece do you Remember Ghost in The Shell, Fullmetal Alchemist, Death Note, Inu Yasha, and my all time favourite - Rurouni Kenshin / Samurai X.

Now first and foremost, I don't want the live action to be an exact copy of the Anime. All of the above Animes I mentioned they have been in one way or another adopted as a live action movie or series and they all are just cheap imitation.

In recent time with its major faults I would say only Cowboy Bebop captured the sense of what a live action adaptation of an Anime should be. The music, the style, the effects were all on point for that show.

So what went wrong with this one. Firstly Luffy seems so weak. The supporting cast is actually better than him. So the casting choice was great but really poor direction. The whole Anime is based on his characterbut. The saving grace is the acting.

Next up the writing. I think the sentences formed were done by someone who doesn't understand how English language screenplay works. That just kills the fun. No way this matches up with the original Japanese at all. And funnily enough there is no Japanese language, theain reason I started liking Anime that it had a entirely different language.

CGI - are pretty good. Better that the Marvel ones at least. In fact CGI is something that's going to ground the show. But, but, but, but, but look at the explosion, look at the water, it's live action, it all feels like, they took humans and are going to model them in an Anime or a game, rather then putting attention to details which will make it feel like live action.

To me this is a live action stand up comedy with someone who tried too hard to copy the original Anime rather recreating it for audiences like us, who started watching it back in 1999, but then went through the internet and graphics revolution.

Also who the hell are these morons rating this as 9/10, I highly doubt they even watched the season 1 of the original Anime.

The Curse is Broken,"One Piece under promised and over delivered.

We were skeptical because most adaptations are garbage...like Death Note...and the curse has lived on for many years.

One Piece broke that curse! And here is why:

The writers did exactly what they needed to do--stick with the source material. Of course there are some slight changes, but they are strategically placed and not overdone.

The camera and editing is top notch, I sometimes feel like I am watching the Anime, and then the beautiful sets and camera work bring it back to Earth.

The acting is PHENOMENAL! Not one bad actor. Luffy and Zoro were perfectly casted.

You won't regret watching this masterpiece.",04-Sep-23,10.0,one piece promised delivered skeptical adaptations garbagelike death noteand curse lived many years one piece broke curse writers exactly needed dostick source material course slight changes strategically placed overdone camera editing top notch sometimes feel like watching anime beautiful sets camera work bring back earth acting phenomenal one bad actor luffy zoro perfectly casted wont regret watching masterpiece
I admit I went in skeptical,"I love the anime and the manga. I watched it back in 2006 and then picked it back up again years later.

For the last 4 years, the anime has been a family affair with my 7 year old daughter and husband loving it right along with me. We're caught up and tune in to watch every week.

So, when Netflix of all things announced they were doing a live action my response was: great. Another thing ruined.

Boy was I wrong!!!

We watched the first 4 episodes in one sitting and couldn't get enough. There are, obviously, some things that have changed, but nothing that negatively impacts the story as it is.

The characters are all absolutely fantastic and the acting is just the correct balance of anime flair and real life intrigue.

I really hope Netflix takes the hint and continues with this amazing series, because it's well worth the cost.

If you're looking for something to watch, I definitely suggest a journey to the grand line. This is One Piece (see what I did there?) that you don't want to miss.",01-Sep-23,9.0,love anime manga watched back picked back years later last years anime family affair year old daughter husband loving right along caught tune watch every week netflix things announced live action response great another thing ruined boy wrong watched first episodes one sitting couldnt get enough obviously things changed nothing negatively impacts story characters absolutely fantastic acting correct balance anime flair real life intrigue really hope netflix takes hint continues amazing series well worth cost youre looking something watch definitely suggest journey grand line one piece see dont want miss
An Attempt poorly Attempt this is no curse breaker,"Hollywood just loves to give their own view on something that they know they can't fully ""adapt"", the entire series is just an amalgamation, and not a well done one, the ""adaptations"" are all so unnecessary it's like you're not hoping to get new people to read the manga/anime because there is not good pacing.

This whole show it's super rushed it feels like the showrunners just expect people not to have any patience and get everything out of the way as fast as possible and since they didn't had a sure fire way to do that they rope in enemies from completely different arcs who had nothing to do with each other in an attempt to connect mingle everything together which doesn't really work because the point was having a main villain in the manga.

The plot line with Koby and Helmeppo some parts got cut which defeated the entire purpose of Helmeppo's change of heart being Koby's courage! WHYY?! For some reason Garp is following Luffy desperatly which is not really in character because he always let him do his thing. After all, Garp had more important things to DO!

The reveal of GARP being Luffy's Grandpa was soo underwhelming it was so random too the crew BEARLY even reacted I guess they justified it because they bearly know Luffy; it kinda makes sense because of the horrible bit of how Zoro and Nami kept saying ""they were not in the crew!"" BUT ZORO WAAS, THEY MADE A PROMISE WHEN ZORO WAS CAPTURE AND HE KEPT UP WITH IT, But the Garp thing that wasn't even supposed to happen until further LIKE WHY?? We literally didn't need to know they could've easily not mentioned anything because that's what Marines do chase and capture Pirates. Luffy ISN'T EVEN SCARED OF HIM WHYY?!!! BECAUSE OF COURSE AMERICANS NEED TO SANITIZE THE HELL OUT OF WITH GARP NOT BEING ROUGHT WITH LUFFY, He wants to fight???? WHAT IS THIS WRITING?!! The small little cannon balls just don't make it exciting, in the anime/manga they made A WAY better job showcasing Garp's strength

Characters, they were all mostly okay, Usopp was the one I was most excited to see how it was portrayed but it was a bit of a let down to see how he acted THEY TOOK AWAY HIS FIIGHT!!! WHYY???! He acted just once and he's so soft spoken there was no Fake confidence like it's characteristic from him!

Nami was alright too, tho I didn't like that they didn't took into consideration that Nami doesn't really needed to fight because she is the type of girl who would let others do the heavy lifting for her so she would always rely on Luffy and Zoro.

Zoro was good too, his choreographies were great.

Sanji, they completely butchered his moment with Zeff It was horrible, they didn't build to Sanji didn't struggle he literally had his stuff packed already, and like nothing he got up, no emotion no nothing, is like Sanji wasn't even rescued; also he did say meat cuts so I'll add bonus points for that, they removed the scene where Zeff gave his feet for him and Sanji never knew, just bad writing all over.

Luffy was a bit of a mixed bag some lines were not delivered well and obviously, some emotions weren't in place for certain scenes but overall it was alright too.

The Arlong Park walk was butchered too, it was night and they waited a whooole night? To go to Arlong park, since Johnny and Yosaku were completely erased the moment where they said to the villagers that they were waiting for HIM was completely gone was bad choice, Luffy's entrance was not as exciting as in the anime which is already a huge letdown, THEY TOOK AWAY BELLMERE'S MOMENT TOO! She was soo badasss when she fight for her daughters with how she TACKLE HIM and put a gun straight to his mouth incredible and completely EREASED, They only kept how she gave her life crying.

I don't have a good feeling about how they could handle the appearance of certain characters because they only work on a fictional setting like Wapol or CHOPPER (OMG PLS NOO I DON'T WANNA SEE HOW THEY MASSACRE HIM)

Overall I think this is a """"""success"""""" with BIG quotes because the bar for Live Actions is EXTREMLY low , they tried to adapt the story and I can appreciate but I don't think they did a job to guaranty a 2nd season, specially by how fast they tried to soar through everything, as a One Piece fan since it's beginning I hope they just put this Live Action to rest, it was a great attempt they deserved the cheers but ultimately the Manga/anime remain the BEST AND ONLY way One Piece could work because that's how the world works.",31-Aug-23,5.0,hollywood loves give view something know cant fully adapt entire series amalgamation well done one adaptations unnecessary like youre hoping get new people read mangaanime good pacing whole show super rushed feels like showrunners expect people patience get everything way fast possible since didnt sure fire way rope enemies completely different arcs nothing attempt connect mingle everything together doesnt really work point main villain manga plot line koby helmeppo parts got cut defeated entire purpose helmeppos change heart kobys courage whyy reason garp following luffy desperatly really character always let thing garp important things reveal garp luffys grandpa soo underwhelming random crew bearly even reacted guess justified bearly know luffy kinda makes sense horrible bit zoro nami kept saying crew zoro waas made promise zoro capture kept garp thing wasnt even supposed happen like literally didnt need know couldve easily mentioned anything thats marines chase capture pirates luffy isnt even scared whyy course americans need sanitize hell garp rought luffy wants fight writing small little cannon balls dont make exciting animemanga made way better job showcasing garps strength characters mostly okay usopp one excited see portrayed bit let see acted took away fiight whyy acted hes soft spoken fake confidence like characteristic nami alright tho didnt like didnt took consideration nami doesnt really needed fight type girl would let others heavy lifting would always rely luffy zoro zoro good choreographies great sanji completely butchered moment zeff horrible didnt build sanji didnt struggle literally stuff packed already like nothing got emotion nothing like sanji wasnt even rescued also say meat cuts ill add bonus points removed scene zeff gave feet sanji never knew bad writing luffy bit mixed bag lines delivered well obviously emotions werent place certain scenes overall alright arlong park walk butchered night waited whooole night go arlong park since johnny yosaku completely erased moment said villagers waiting completely gone bad choice luffys entrance exciting anime already huge letdown took away bellmeres moment soo badasss fight daughters tackle put gun straight mouth incredible completely ereased kept gave life crying dont good feeling could handle appearance certain characters work fictional setting like wapol chopper omg pls noo dont wanna see massacre overall think success big quotes bar live actions extremly low tried adapt story appreciate dont think job guaranty nd season specially fast tried soar everything one piece fan since beginning hope put live action rest great attempt deserved cheers ultimately mangaanime remain best way one piece could work thats world works
"Up to this point, my preferred TV series following Game of Thrones and Vikings.","Just completed my latest journey through the epic world of One Piece, and what a captivating adventure it has been! This is a series that not only stands the test of time but also invites multiple revisits with open arms. Allow me to delve into the many facets that make this season a remarkable spectacle, even though I had a minor gripe with one particular character.

First and foremost, it's no secret that the creators of One Piece are masters of their craft. They have consistently demonstrated their storytelling prowess throughout the series, and this season is no exception. The way they weave intricate plotlines, develop multifaceted characters, and blend humor, emotion, and action is nothing short of brilliant. It's evident that a great deal of thought and creativity went into crafting this season's narrative.

However, I must admit there was one character who didn't quite meet my expectations, and that's Buggy the Clown. While Buggy is undoubtedly a significant presence in the One Piece world, I couldn't help but feel that his portrayal in this season fell slightly short. Buggy's character has the potential to be a truly sinister and memorable antagonist, yet his performance in this season left something to be desired. While his acting was passable, it failed to capture the level of greatness I had hoped for. Nevertheless, this minor hiccup doesn't overshadow the overall excellence of the series.

One of the standout aspects of this season is the incredibly realistic and enthralling fight sequences. Each battle is meticulously choreographed, immersing the audience in a world where the laws of physics are bent and extraordinary powers collide. The fights are not just about physical combat but also about strategy, willpower, and the bonds between characters. This season takes the action to new heights, and it's a testament to the creators' dedication to delivering top-notch entertainment.

One particular standout is the portrayal of Zoro, brought to life by a talented actor. Zoro's character has always been a fan favorite, and this season does justice to his skill as a swordsman and his unwavering determination. The battles involving Zoro are nothing short of awe-inspiring, and the actor's commitment to the role shines through in every scene. It's performances like these that elevate the series to greatness.

As I bask in the afterglow of this season's conclusion, I can't help but eagerly anticipate what lies ahead in season two. The creators have set a high bar with this installment, and I have no doubt that the next season will raise the stakes even higher. The world of One Piece is boundless, filled with untold adventures, mysteries, and new characters waiting to be discovered. It's a testament to the series' enduring appeal that fans like me are already counting down the days until the next chapter in this epic tale.

In conclusion, One Piece continues to be a shining example of what anime can achieve when it's crafted with passion, creativity, and a deep understanding of storytelling. This season, despite a minor setback with the portrayal of Buggy the Clown, excels in nearly every aspect. From its masterful storytelling to its realistic and captivating fight sequences, One Piece has once again proven why it's a beloved and enduring series. With season two on the horizon, the future of One Piece looks even more promising, and I, for one, cannot wait to embark on the next thrilling adventure with Luffy and his crew. If you haven't already, do yourself a favor and dive into the world of One Piece-you won't be disappointed.",11-Sep-23,9.0,completed latest journey epic world one piece captivating adventure series stands test time also invites multiple revisits open arms allow delve many facets make season remarkable spectacle even though minor gripe one particular character first foremost secret creators one piece masters craft consistently demonstrated storytelling prowess throughout series season exception way weave intricate plotlines develop multifaceted characters blend humor emotion action nothing short brilliant evident great deal thought creativity went crafting seasons narrative however must admit one character didnt quite meet expectations thats buggy clown buggy undoubtedly significant presence one piece world couldnt help feel portrayal season fell slightly short buggys character potential truly sinister memorable antagonist yet performance season left something desired acting passable failed capture level greatness hoped nevertheless minor hiccup doesnt overshadow overall excellence series one standout aspects season incredibly realistic enthralling fight sequences battle meticulously choreographed immersing audience world laws physics bent extraordinary powers collide fights physical combat also strategy willpower bonds characters season takes action new heights testament creators dedication delivering topnotch entertainment one particular standout portrayal zoro brought life talented actor zoros character always fan favorite season justice skill swordsman unwavering determination battles involving zoro nothing short aweinspiring actors commitment role shines every scene performances like elevate series greatness bask afterglow seasons conclusion cant help eagerly anticipate lies ahead season two creators set high bar installment doubt next season raise stakes even higher world one piece boundless filled untold adventures mysteries new characters waiting discovered testament series enduring appeal fans like already counting days next chapter epic tale conclusion one piece continues shining example anime achieve crafted passion creativity deep understanding storytelling season despite minor setback portrayal buggy clown excels nearly every aspect masterful storytelling realistic captivating fight sequences one piece proven beloved enduring series season two horizon future one piece looks even promising one cannot wait embark next thrilling adventure luffy crew havent already favor dive world one pieceyou wont disappointed
I enjoyed it,"Overall, I enjoyed it, and you can tell that alot of hard work has gone into this series. If you enjoyed the anime, you'll enjoy this. I haven't seen the anime in roughly 15yrs, and I still enjoyed it.

The only negative things I have to say are....some of the fashion styles didn't look good on a non animated character. They looked a bit too fake, and didn't suit the actors wearing whatever their character was. That though is nothing new when it comes to live adaptations of anime and computer games. Also, the clothes seemed a bit too clean, and looked brand new. That just didn't look right considering a lot of the characters are technically in poverty.

Overall though, it's a sold Netflix series, and I'd say it's not just for younger audiences, but all ages.",01-Sep-23,7.0,overall enjoyed tell alot hard work gone series enjoyed anime youll enjoy havent seen anime roughly yrs still enjoyed negative things say aresome fashion styles didnt look good non animated character looked bit fake didnt suit actors wearing whatever character though nothing new comes live adaptations anime computer games also clothes seemed bit clean looked brand new didnt look right considering lot characters technically poverty overall though sold netflix series id say younger audiences ages
"Pretty good casting, with a bit too great cost of compressing the story into live-action.","(Dont read this if you haven't watched the show, and haven't read the manga/seen the anime).

I was looking forward to this, and i just couldn't stop sighing after 3-4 episodes. There is just too much focus on the things that aren't One Piece. Why is Koby's development being in focus so early? Why is Garp not an idiot? Why does Luffy have self-awareness? So many questionable choices of tweaking the base characters from the story, which makes it difficult to see how they come to have the power and resilience to enter the Grand Line.

The literal decimating of proper bad guys like Arlong into some village bandit making a ruckus at the restaurant just made me sigh so hard... i couldn't go on. I wanted to, because it is One Piece!

But i realized that everything i like about the manga is absent in this interpretation of the story. The heart is in the right place, i believe, but it leaves too many questions for me unanswered as to why you would choose to compress the story, but at the same waste time on developing Koby when he joins the marines... and ruining Garp entirely. And then Arlong. And then Mihawk.. etc.

I think there's great potential for a live action One Piece, but it's just not the right people doing the writing. They should have taken a second turn really getting to the _core_ of what makes One Piece so great - suspense before discovering and then fighting the seemingly impossible-to-beat bad guy, and really touching and breaking the heart of the audience with the tragic back-stories of the characters. It just can't convince me that Zoro is really emotionally invested in his dream to become the greatest swordsman. The casual challenging Mihawk where he rather seems to believe that he can beat Mihawk (which is more complex in the manga/anime, where he really is betting his life on challenging a Warlord and seems to know it deep down). There's a lot of details to consider to make it really come to life, but i believe and hope that it might be possible with better and more invested writers.",01-Sep-23,5.0,dont read havent watched show havent read mangaseen anime looking forward couldnt stop sighing episodes much focus things arent one piece kobys development focus early garp idiot luffy selfawareness many questionable choices tweaking base characters story makes difficult see come power resilience enter grand line literal decimating proper bad guys like arlong village bandit making ruckus restaurant made sigh hard couldnt go wanted one piece realized everything like manga absent interpretation story heart right place believe leaves many questions unanswered would choose compress story waste time developing koby joins marines ruining garp entirely arlong mihawk etc think theres great potential live action one piece right people writing taken second turn really getting core makes one piece great suspense discovering fighting seemingly impossibletobeat bad guy really touching breaking heart audience tragic backstories characters cant convince zoro really emotionally invested dream become greatest swordsman casual challenging mihawk rather seems believe beat mihawk complex mangaanime really betting life challenging warlord seems know deep theres lot details consider make really come life believe hope might possible better invested writers
Wow the best live action ever and it did not disappoint!,"This is the best anime live action I've ever seen which broke the trend of anime having bad livd section adaptions. The production and settings are amazing, they really madd it look like real life pirates in the 18th century mixed with modern day pirates which perfectly fits the world of One Piece. The costumes are incredibly design which is really accurate, everything looks so real. However some characters with massive sizes in the manga aren't big in the anime but that's how it is in live action. The setting really gives it a serious tone which is kind of unlike the manga or anime.

The main casts work perfectly well, the acting is really believable. They've changed some of the story to make it fit a TV series is great but some parts felt a bit rushed. Oda himself approved it so I don't have complaints. The CGI for devil fruits are also fantastic with Luffy and Buggy calling their attack names out without sounding cringe. In the live action they don't have many named attacks besides devil fruit users. The action scenes are very well choreographed making it so exciting. The direction was done so well too because tbe actors all moved so coordinated and delivered their lines without sounding cringe.

The casts played Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji so well on top of the supporting casts of Garp and Koby playing a much bigger role than the manga. Oda has done q an incredible job at choosing these actors! One Piece being narrated by Ian McShane is just legendary because his voice fits it so well and after all he did play Blackbeard.

"I'm a huge fan, so take this with a grain of salt","Translating an IP of this magnitude, of course the first responsibility is to the fans. So let's take a look!

It's no exaggeration to say that this series set a new standard for a similar adaptations in the future. Their commitment to the aesthetics, and their care in knitting the cartoonish side of the manga, and the realist side of live-action together, without offending the logic of each side, finally managed to present an adaptation that was not only a tool to justify the new medium, but more of a tool to appreciate both worlds!

They used a new aspect, realism, not to insult the cartoonist logic that is ingrained in the fan perspective. Instead of removing the comical factors because they don't make sense, they copy them to a realistic level that makes sense. So at the same time, they can lead fans to understand that there are things that have to be lowered for the realistic realm to work, and also show that there are new things here that were previously unexplored in the cartoonist realm.

That's also because the East Blue Saga, when compared to the other sagas, is the weakest in terms of structure. Eiichiro Oda, the creator, at this point had yet to understand how big the scope of the world he was going to create was, so the connection between plots was minimal. But three decades on, fans have a good idea of the scope of what's being talked about, and those behind the series clearly understand how to utilize it to build a more perfect world-building! As a result, it's not just a new rendition, but rather additional content that expands the overall lore of the series.

But there is a price to pay for realism in adapting a work as cartoonish as this, especially when it comes to ""impact"": In the manga, One Piece relies heavily on the juxtaposition of silly moments to serious moments, in building up the suspension towards the impact panels, which will be the main emphasis in the resolution of the entire conflict. The loss of the ridiculousness characteristics for the characters, makes the series limp in establishing the motivation towards those impactful moments. The relationship between the characters and the conflict often feels awkward, because there are actually silly moments there in the original source material to break the ice, but they are absent or minimized here in the interest of conducive realism. It is unfortunate that many of the impactful moments in this adaptation are ineffective when compared to its predecessor. Proving that the cartoonish side of the story is not just a gimmick, but absolutely integral to One Piece.",05-Sep-23,7.0,translating ip magnitude course first responsibility fans lets take look exaggeration say series set new standard similar adaptations future commitment aesthetics care knitting cartoonish side manga realist side liveaction together without offending logic side finally managed present adaptation tool justify new medium tool appreciate worlds used new aspect realism insult cartoonist logic ingrained fan perspective instead removing comical factors dont make sense copy realistic level makes sense time lead fans understand things lowered realistic realm work also show new things previously unexplored cartoonist realm thats also east blue saga compared sagas weakest terms structure eiichiro oda creator point yet understand big scope world going create connection plots minimal three decades fans good idea scope whats talked behind series clearly understand utilize build perfect worldbuilding result new rendition rather additional content expands overall lore series price pay realism adapting work cartoonish especially comes impact manga one piece relies heavily juxtaposition silly moments serious moments building suspension towards impact panels main emphasis resolution entire conflict loss ridiculousness characteristics characters makes series limp establishing motivation towards impactful moments relationship characters conflict often feels awkward actually silly moments original source material break ice absent minimized interest conducive realism unfortunate many impactful moments adaptation ineffective compared predecessor proving cartoonish side story gimmick absolutely integral one piece

One Piece review,"O far, so halfway-decent. One Piece fans may find some assurance in Oda giving his nod of approval for the final product, which, from the look of it, seems to have benefitted from Netflix's deep coffers. It's not a seamless transition from manga/anime to live action (point-of-reference-wise, 2017's Ghost in the Shell got the visuals right, if not much else), but it's consistent in its cheery-goofy-bright tone and aesthetic, maintaining a cartoonishness that doesn't always translate well, but is nevertheless entertaining. Luffy's rubber-bod will always be, well, a stretch, but Godoy sells it with his you'll-find-I'm-full-of-surprises, wide-eyed, impish take on the character - a prime example of an inspired performance transcending the limitations of nutty visual effects.

Godoy sets the tone well for the series; as aesthetically loony as it can be, the first episode establishes a winning character dynamic that one can foresee reverberating throughout the series. Luffy is a won't-take-no-for-an-answer type who doesn't try to inspire others - he's just inspiring in his optimism. Koby shakes off his self-doubt in his presence, and it's pretty clear that Luffy will soon win over Zoro and Kami, whose pragmatism will yin out his yang. This is what worked well for a One Piece newcomer like myself. Will diehards embrace the inevitable tweaks in translation and the plentiful and entertaining, if not always memorable, blasts of frantic action? I think they might. (They surely get their moments of that valuable 21st-century currency: fan service.)

This ain't it,"Quality-wise it's cosplayers doing a fan film. Gol D. Roger with the obvious glue on mustache, the marine dude with his plastic axe hand and the fake metal jaw. Bucky with the plastic nose, nothing feels like it's actually part of the world.

Everything looks like it's made of plastic, especially weapons that should be made of metal, keys, the one sword from the trailer.

The show also doesn't have an Opening, just the One Piece text, which is insanely lame, the intros are such a big part of anime and they just decided to not do it?

The good thing is that the pacing seems quite fast, and they probably will skip all the filter stuff.",01-Sep-23,5.0,qualitywise cosplayers fan film gol roger obvious glue mustache marine dude plastic axe hand fake metal jaw bucky plastic nose nothing feels like actually part world everything looks like made plastic especially weapons made metal keys one sword trailer show also doesnt opening one piece text insanely lame intros big part anime decided good thing pacing seems quite fast probably skip filter stuff

WOW! Finally a good anime adaptation!!,"This is the first good anime adaptation I've ever watched. Everything is awesome, and it really feels like one piece! And the actors/actresses are great too. Especially Zoro and Buggy. I've laughed at every scene Buggy was in. And the other characters are great too.

One of the things I slightly disliked is that we don't get to hear some of the music from the anime, especially Zoro's theme. But the OST is generally okay, some of the musics are very good, and we get to hear ""We are!"" a couple of times, so I'm happy :)

Luffy's streching animation and fights are also sometimes a little weird, but that's expected. One piece is a difficult anime for adapting into live action, and they did a great job in general.

With Netflix usually ditching good tv-shows, I don't know if we'll ever get more seasons, but I really hope by some miracle we will.",02-Sep-23,10.0,first good anime adaptation ive ever watched everything awesome really feels like one piece actorsactresses great especially zoro buggy ive laughed every scene buggy characters great one things slightly disliked dont get hear music anime especially zoros theme ost generally okay musics good get hear couple times im happy luffys streching animation fights also sometimes little weird thats expected one piece difficult anime adapting live action great job general netflix usually ditching good tvshows dont know well ever get seasons really hope miracle
"Looks good, feels good, is good 9.5/10","My only complaint is the length of the episodes, standard 50-60 minutes don't work well here. Some episodes feel long and heavy and others have to slap together a few different plots to fill the time. 30 minutes per episode would've made the run more dynamic

I can't emphasize enough how good everything is. I went in completely blind, not too interested in pirates or action. And now - I'm obsessed. It's unreal how nice everything looks. Ships are stunning, landscape is beautiful, costumes are great. Translating wacky super powers into our world was done very very well. I don't think there was a character I didn't enjoy and I am convinced Godoy is Luffy in essence, a drawing came to life and there is no other explanation. I'm still shocked at how good the fighting scenes were, so smooth and exciting at the same time. I was glued to the screen to not miss any move.

My annoyance with live actions comes from the question - why do you exist, what's your purpose (other than money). And I think netflix hit the jackpot here. Manga (and anime)'s length and unusual art style have made them less accessible to some people. This is a fine bridge to help you cross into the world of frightening 1000+ episodes and I'm certain new fans will be born in subsequent days.",05-Sep-23,9.0,complaint length episodes standard minutes dont work well episodes feel long heavy others slap together different plots fill time minutes per episode wouldve made run dynamic cant emphasize enough good everything went completely blind interested pirates action im obsessed unreal nice everything looks ships stunning landscape beautiful costumes great translating wacky super powers world done well dont think character didnt enjoy convinced godoy luffy essence drawing came life explanation im still shocked good fighting scenes smooth exciting time glued screen miss move annoyance live actions comes question exist whats purpose money think netflix hit jackpot manga animes length unusual art style made less accessible people fine bridge help cross world frightening episodes im certain new fans born subsequent days
Finally it works!!!,"It took a while ( maybe more than a while) for Netflix to capture the essence of an anime but they finally did it! Engaging since the first episode, it leaves you wanting more ( always a good sign). It is difficult to respect the character building that the anime has but this live action respect each character. However some charactersi think will come to be more relevant with time in the next seasons.

THE ONE PIECE IS REAL!!!,"One Piece (2023) is a game-changer in the realm of live-action anime adaptations. A must watch for everyone. With an astonishing budget of over $17 million per episode, this series spares no expense in bringing Eiichiro Oda's iconic world to life.

What truly sets it apart is the commitment to staying faithful to the source material. The casting is spot-on, the characters feel authentic, and the chemistry between the Straw Hat Pirates is palpable. I√±aki Godoy as Luffy, Emily Rudd as Nami, and Mackenyu as Zoro shine in their respective roles, making this adaptation a true treasure.

In a sea of lackluster live-action adaptations, One Piece (2023) stands tall as the definitive success story. It's a must-watch for fans and a compelling introduction for newcomers. Prepare to be blown away!

I highly recommend this show to anyone who loves the original One Piece, pirate adventures, anime adaptations, or those who want to experience the essence of One Piece without committing to hundreds of episodes.

Give chance to your dream : A wonderful show,"If you're seeking an extraordinary adventure and a dose of pirate excitement, look no further than 'One Piece.' Let me tell you why this series is an absolute gem, with a special nod to the fantastic portrayal of our main characters.

The casting choices for the entire crew are nothing short of genius. Each actor has not just stepped into their character's shoes but has become the character. Now, let's dive into the heart of the crew, starting with the unstoppable force that is Monkey D. Luffy.

Luffy, played with infectious enthusiasm, is the driving force behind the series. His unwavering determination, the infectious joy he finds in every adventure, and his dream of becoming the Pirate King are brought to life with incredible authenticity. It's more than just an act; it's a genuine embodiment of the spirit of 'One Piece.'

Roronoa Zoro, the crew's stoic swordsman, is portrayed with a strength that resonates on screen. The actor captures Zoro's unyielding loyalty and unmatched sword skills, bringing a sense of reliability and power to the crew.

Nami, the crew's navigator, is portrayed with fiery determination. The actor embodies Nami's intelligence, resourcefulness, and the subtle vulnerability that makes her character so endearing. Her evolution from a sharp-witted navigator to an integral part of the crew is depicted with finesse.

Sanji, the charismatic chef with a kick, is portrayed with flair. The actor captures Sanji's chivalry, passion for cooking, and the humorous dynamic he adds to the crew. Sanji's comedic yet skillful fighting style is a joy to watch.

What sets this series apart is its commitment to showcasing the strengths, quirks, and growth of each character. The chemistry among the crew is palpable, and the interactions feel genuine. The scriptwriters and actors have successfully translated the essence of these beloved characters from manga to screen, and it's an absolute delight to witness.

In conclusion, 'One Piece' is not just a series; it's a celebration of characters. From Luffy's infectious energy to Zoro's steadfastness, Nami's determination, and Sanji's flair, each member of the crew shines in their unique way. The series doesn't just tell a story; it brings these characters to life in a way that will captivate both long-time fans and newcomers alike. It's a must-watch for anyone ready to embark on a grand adventure filled with laughter, camaraderie, and the indomitable spirit of the Straw Hat Pirates.",29-Sep-23,10.0,youre seeking extraordinary adventure dose pirate excitement look one piece let tell series absolute gem special nod fantastic portrayal main characters casting choices entire crew nothing short genius actor stepped characters shoes become character lets dive heart crew starting unstoppable force monkey luffy luffy played infectious enthusiasm driving force behind series unwavering determination infectious joy finds every adventure dream becoming pirate king brought life incredible authenticity act genuine embodiment spirit one piece roronoa zoro crews stoic swordsman portrayed strength resonates screen actor captures zoros unyielding loyalty unmatched sword skills bringing sense reliability power crew nami crews navigator portrayed fiery determination actor embodies namis intelligence resourcefulness subtle vulnerability makes character endearing evolution sharpwitted navigator integral part crew depicted finesse sanji charismatic chef kick portrayed flair actor captures sanjis chivalry passion cooking humorous dynamic adds crew sanjis comedic yet skillful fighting style joy watch sets series apart commitment showcasing strengths quirks growth character chemistry among crew palpable interactions feel genuine scriptwriters actors successfully translated essence beloved characters manga screen absolute delight witness conclusion one piece series celebration characters luffys infectious energy zoros steadfastness namis determination sanjis flair member crew shines unique way series doesnt tell story brings characters life way captivate longtime fans newcomers alike mustwatch anyone ready embark grand adventure filled laughter camaraderie indomitable spirit straw hat pirates
My favorite of all time,"This show.. OMGGG!! I absolutely LOVE this show. I didn't watch the animated but the live action is PERFECT!!! I think this is honestly the best show I have EVER seen..!! The actors are amazing, the acting is phenomenal!! I just love that monkey Dee Luffy wants to be a pirate and that all of them said ""we're not a crew"" and that ""we'll never be a crew"" and then towards the end they became an amazing crew. The absolute BEST PART was the very end last episode they showed the guy that was in the beggining that raised Luffy. So proud and happy of him for being ""wanted"" by the navy (I honestly forget what they were named exactly) just the best show ever.

I loved it!,"I have watched One Piece for the last 8 years and have never missed a single weekly episode. I did not have much hopes from this series and even avoided starting it for a week. But I started it today and don't regret it at all. It is very difficult to get characters and animations to the level of anime. But they have done great justice to most part of it. I like the main character and seeing the One Piece world in real life is like a dream come true.

The side characters have also been great. I would even go ahead and say that Buggy was done even better than the anime or manga.

So set aside the hesitation and enjoy the ride.",10-Sep-23,10.0,watched one piece last years never missed single weekly episode much hopes series even avoided starting week started today dont regret difficult get characters animations level anime done great justice part like main character seeing one piece world real life like dream come true side characters also great would even go ahead say buggy done even better anime manga set aside hesitation enjoy ride

The actors that they choose for each character quickly became an interesting and involved piece of the story as the show goes along. I really enjoyed watching this series and there aren't many newer series that can capture my attention like this one has.

First Live Action Adaptation I've Thoroughly Enjoyed,"I literally could care less that some of the camera angles are a bit too cheesy, that some of the wigs could've been better, or that they didn't include 'x y z' specific detail from the manga. The cast KILLED it, I'm not sure I can see any regular human but I√±aki as Luffy anymore. The costuming killed it, making sure costumes fit characters but weren't overly repetitive. And the set departments absolutely killed it, they heavily leaned into the island concept which gave a lot more life to the universe that I initially had expected. The people who made this clearly put a stupendous amount of thought and it worked. They nailed the vibe of one piece, and matched the character dynamics extremely well.

In my opinion, one of the challenges of adapting an anime is always that thin line between being too serious so that it becomes unbelievable, and too ridiculous so that all emotional depth is lost. This is a live action adaptation of a manga about a RUBBER MAN who wants to be king of pirates. That is an inherently goofy premise, making that thin line even more precarious to tread, but they pulled it off.

This is a great introduction to the one piece universe if the manga is too intimidating, and it's a fun version to watch for old fans as well with a good amount of Easter eggs that never become overwhelming. By no means is the show perfect, by itself, it is closer to and 8/10. However this is the best live action adaption I've seen, leaps and bounds better than I could've ever expected from a live action show where the source material is so difficult to adapt, which bumped it up to a 10.

Important plot and scenes not included. Characters don't resemble the originals. The conversations are just lame and somewhat cringe.,"The Characters:

The characters are just so unlikable in the show. Luffy hitting Coby is so out of place and it felt horrible. The girl from the first episode was supposed to sneak inside the Marine Base, so she could feed Zoro and that scene was so heartwarming in the manga, it made Zoro so likable (but instead we got a *funny* scene and Zoro being ""mad"" for no reason)... Garp and Sengoku felt like they can barely breath.. Garp is completely different character, it's actually sad..

The conversations and the plot:

instead of cool conversations and character development, we get sloppy fighting scene (Which I won't criticize, since they did their best). The writers value the fighting over the plot, the only reason why people like one piece it's because of the plot, the conversations and the relationship between the characters, instead of those moments we got fighting..

The cast:

I think the actors are doing their best and it's alright, I think they have done a good job in this part. I've seen the interviews with the actors and they seem to like one piece as well. But the writers should step up a little bit!",01-Sep-23,3.0,characters characters unlikable show luffy hitting coby place felt horrible girl first episode supposed sneak inside marine base could feed zoro scene heartwarming manga made zoro likable instead got funny scene zoro mad reason garp sengoku felt like barely breath garp completely different character actually sad conversations plot instead cool conversations character development get sloppy fighting scene wont criticize since best writers value fighting plot reason people like one piece plot conversations relationship characters instead moments got fighting cast think actors best alright think done good job part ive seen interviews actors seem like one piece well writers step little bit
Best thing since stranger things well done Netty!,"Honestly most adaptations these days suck absolute balls!

PERFECT!,"I'm around 350 episodes in, in the anime. I love One piece. As an adult, i sometimes fast forward the long episodes, because like a lot of anime, they pull the string a lot of the stories. So i was worried that the show would be either the stories cut to short or too long like in the anime.

Let just say that the balance is perfect. They did it!

And it's also a perfect balance between animation and human.

"Very entertaining, with a stellar cast!!!!!!","I have just finished my One Piece Marathon, and I just had to write a review! I am a One Piece (the Anime) fan, albeit not a hardcore one, just someone who has watched various episodes from various seasons, but I don't follow it fanatically.

This Netflix series is fantastic! It is very entertaining, true to the spirit of the anime (and I suppose to the manga), with various little details which are instantly recognizable by someone who has watched the anime. The locations are great, and the CGI not overwhelming, at all.

What stands out for me are the characters and their actors.... They are all exceptional! I√±aki Godoy is AMAZING as Luffy, so loveable and energetic, and he captures the kind hearted, innocent but not naive persona of Luffy. His energy was contagious, and I caught myself having a huge smile on my face, without realizing it , every time he was happy on the screen. It was such a pleasure watching him, and I could not think of anyone better than him in the role.

The rest of the cast is stellar too, both in their physical similarity to their characters and in their acting. They all manage to convey their characters' traits without seemingly trying!

All in all, a series which can be watched by both fans and no fans, and it will deliver! I was sad when it ended, and I cannot wait for the next season! I hope Netflix continues this series in the same spirit, with the same enthusiasm and respect to the manga and anime!",01-Sep-23,10.0,finished one piece marathon write review one piece anime fan albeit hardcore one someone watched various episodes various seasons dont follow fanatically netflix series fantastic entertaining true spirit anime suppose manga various little details instantly recognizable someone watched anime locations great cgi overwhelming stands characters actors exceptional iaki godoy amazing luffy loveable energetic captures kind hearted innocent naive persona luffy energy contagious caught huge smile face without realizing every time happy screen pleasure watching could think anyone better role rest cast stellar physical similarity characters acting manage convey characters traits without seemingly trying series watched fans fans deliver sad ended cannot wait next season hope netflix continues series spirit enthusiasm respect manga anime

Went in with the lowest expectations and I'm blown away,"Netflix, and others, have shown they can not adapt an anime. When I first heard a out One Piece being adapted I just thought I'd do what I always do and forget about it.

I'm in utter shock. They actually did it. They followed the formula from The Last of Us, don't change the source but enhance it for the live action. It sounds so easy to do but I'm in shock. Great job with casting, cinematography(clearly an anime fan), direction, practical effects, etc.

"As a long time fan of the series, this is amazing. (spoiler free)","To preface, Is it 1:1 with the Anime/Manga? Of course not, if you want to watch 1000+ episodes of one piece, watch the anime, read the manga, whatever.

This covers roughly the first 50 or so episodes of the anime in 8 ~45 minute long episodes, and honestly? It feels very well paced. Everything/one is there, just not everything got the same level of camera time as the original, fights are not as prolonged, some lesser fights were completely removed (though characters do tend to be there in the background serving lesser roles).

What this show lacks in combat (which there is still plenty) it makes up for in plot. Nothing feels forced, there are small things slid in here and there that I think are pronounced enough that everyone, not just the long time fans of the series, would take notice.

And for anime/manga readers? There is so much fan service in the way of easter eggs. I wont spoil any here, but just know its very worth it to watch.

Blown away,"Admittedly it's been 20 years since I've regularly watched One Piece and I can't say I've watched all of its many many episodes. Let's say eventually life just got in the way of my anime bingings.

But man, did this show feels just... RIGHT!

I wasn't too wowed with the trailers, but the show itself just hits bullseye in all the departments. I cared for every single character. Superb writing and acting all around. There was suspense and just fun things to see non-stop. The sets and makeup were both top notch. The action choreography? Chef's kiss! The special effects? Cartoonish? Of course! It's based on an anime after all. But it was done in such an effective manner it blended perfectly into the all over vibe of the show.

But most importantly, it just captured the spirit of One Piece bang on. Such an amazing fun watch.

Thanks for everyone involved in creating this for making me enjoy something nostalgic in such a fresh and exciting way.

I had been very apprehensive after seeing two of my favorite shows from way back when getting... well... less than ideal adaptations (Death Note and Cowboy Bebop).

But this, absolutely amazing. For One Piece fans as well as for people who just like fun, action and pirates, served up with a good dash of fantasy.

Best anime adaption so far,"Starting this I went in with pretty low expectations, most anime adaptions are hardly worth a watch as they usually get the low budget b-movie treatment. But as a One Piece fan i had to give it a go and was pleasantly surprised, mostly. The cast are perfect, with a lot of thought througout the whole cast. The pacing is high, as a fan of the original series I'm a bit dissapointed that some of the best parts of the anime was cut and that detailed fights where glanced over in a minute or two. Storytelling and CGI are way above other adaptations. A solid 8 in my book. And that's all I have to say about that.",02-Sep-23,8.0,starting went pretty low expectations anime adaptions hardly worth watch usually get low budget bmovie treatment one piece fan give go pleasantly surprised mostly cast perfect lot thought througout whole cast pacing high fan original series im bit dissapointed best parts anime cut detailed fights glanced minute two storytelling cgi way adaptations solid book thats say
This was not what I expected,"I'm sort of a BIG Anime fan - heck the majority of reviews I have on the site are anime - and I'm sort of a stickler for something.

I have NOT - at all - liked the Netflix adaptions of anything they've made in Anime, it's been mostly bad and in some points horrendous.

So I was worried about this, I mean it's One Piece - I make jokes about it in the Bebop review - and I have said I'd never touch it. Then I learned (oh and spoilers going on here IMdB) that they'd be translating the entire East Blue arc for the first season.

And I said to myself ""they had better get THAT scene right"" and I realised to myself I'd ""have"" to watch it to find out if they did.

And...well...

Atarimaeda!!!

I was utterly blown away by the level of passion and detail put into this series, the love that looks to have been put into every part of the sets, to the wardrobes to the acting itself.

This is so far beyond my expectations that I cannot even fathom how well it was done, it's not a 1-1 remake of the manga and anime it's condensed quite a bit but it's done so much with what I did that I cannot ever ask for a more faithful adaption of the source material.

I am eating crow right now as I thought this would be the most terrible thing I've ever seen, but the entire team just outdid everything here.

End of the live action curse.,"Let me just start by saying that I have been watching one piece for as long as I can remember, I love and adore the anime and the manga so at first I was nervous when I heard that Netflix was going to create a live action of my favourite anime of all time.

It is amazing , there are a few things that could've been better in my opinion eg. The way luffy says gum gum in the live action doesn't sound right to me , lucky roux not being super obese , Benn Beckmann being old ( he was young when luffy was a kid ) and the main thing that bothered me was usopp not having his well known long nose , I have watched Up to episode 6.

Definitely a lot better then every other live action adaptation ever made.",01-Sep-23,8.0,let start saying watching one piece long remember love adore anime manga first nervous heard netflix going create live action favourite anime time amazing things couldve better opinion eg way luffy says gum gum live action doesnt sound right lucky roux super obese benn beckmann old young luffy kid main thing bothered usopp well known long nose watched episode definitely lot better every live action adaptation ever made
I'm Furious!!,"I loved the Netflix adaptation! Finally a show keeping to its roots!!! Thank you for one Netflix.

An awesome first season,"Huge fan of the manga/anime series. I can thoroughly say that I was highly entertained by the live-action series.

It maintains a perfect balance of staying loyal to the essence of the source material, while also adding plenty of twists and turns that provide a fresh feel to this adaptation.

There's plenty in there for the newer fans to understand the main story while giving the older fans a refreshing look at the story without feeling like it's a word-for-word retelling of the manga/anime.

"mixed bag. some parts are extremely excellent, some not as much","I write it as a fan of the source material, so maybe someone with fresh eyes would view it differently.

Most of the changes made to the story, I thought were quite good, really streamlined the story and it flowed well. Each portion felt different and fresh from each other and a bit from the source, while keeping to the themes, the feel and fun it originally had. Some of them bogged it down (mostly the marines b-plot which I was fifty fifty on).

In regards to character development and portrayal, I really loved Buggy- 12/10 for me very wiry and fun, Luffy was excellent- funny and joyous, Arlong, Nami and Koby were great (although it was weird to see Koby played by a women) they had nice depth and development. I wish we had seen more depth out of the rest of the core crew but they played their part well (not to spoil, but there are some things that were omitted that would better show their characters)

The action was great- unrealistically (and) fun, 9/10.

In regard to how the rest looked- mostly great! Some nitpicks: Sanji at the end of his flashback didn't look like he went through what he went through, too many closeups, some of the fishmen prosthetics, and other thing that didn't mattered much.

Big dislike - the end with Garp.

Not great. I really wanted to like it.,"I am 6 episodes in and not feeling super motivated to keep watching.

Acting is not very good. I'm not convinced by the flat and one dimensional dialogue. I was hoping to feel a strong portrayal of the pursuit of freedom and purpose, but it just didn't hit home for me.

Some of the actors did a good job, particularly Buggy and Helmeppo.

Designs were not great, the costumes were simply awful, they were stiff looking and way too clean to be pirates and sailors that don't have access to dry cleaners. They look like something out of a middle school play and really don't help absorb you into the story.

I thought they did a good job on the snail transponders, they were quite funny, the sea king also looked great.

As for world building, I liked some of the initial shots of Shell's Town, Baratie and Going Merry. But thought they could've emphasized the free open world more through the story.

The fight scenes with both Buggy and Kuro were both also inside of dimly lit indoor locations, which just didn't feel right for me, I wanted to see these fights have a bit more grandiose outside, but I guess they went for the cheap option, and it felt that way.

All in all, they gave it a fair go, but at the end of the day it still just feels like another poorly executed Netflix show, which is not fair to the source material, the fans and the crew involved in the production.",03-Sep-23,4.0,episodes feeling super motivated keep watching acting good im convinced flat one dimensional dialogue hoping feel strong portrayal pursuit freedom purpose didnt hit home actors good job particularly buggy helmeppo designs great costumes simply awful stiff looking way clean pirates sailors dont access dry cleaners look like something middle school play really dont help absorb story thought good job snail transponders quite funny sea king also looked great world building liked initial shots shells town baratie going merry thought couldve emphasized free open world story fight scenes buggy kuro also inside dimly lit indoor locations didnt feel right wanted see fights bit grandiose outside guess went cheap option felt way gave fair go end day still feels like another poorly executed netflix show fair source material fans crew involved production
The Best Live Adaptation I Have Seen,"Live adaptation has always been tricky because it is almost impossible to translate one medium into another. The great thing is that Netflix has the resources and the dedication to make it happen, and they made it happen. It isn't perfect, but it gets the job done.

I like how they weren't scared and made changes to the story without changing the major plot points. The early introduction of Garp was a smart move. They obviously had to make some changes because it would have been almost impossible to cover so much without making certain changes.

The casting is great, but everyone can find one or two character castings that they don't agree with. This is natural because we can't find real people who look just like the anime every single time.

The biggest disappointment for me was how Arlong wasn't looking much like his anime counterpart. They should have gone for the menacing look with heavy CGI, and I hope that they spend more on CGI and do justice to the characters that are introduced later.

Those who watch the anime or read the manga know how crazy some of the characters look. If they can't design the characters properly, things can go wrong quickly. So the major issue I have is with the character design of Arlong, but everything else was pretty good.

Overall, this is a nice start and makes me hopeful for more seasons of this fantastic live adaptation.",02-Sep-23,9.0,live adaptation always tricky almost impossible translate one medium another great thing netflix resources dedication make happen made happen isnt perfect gets job done like werent scared made changes story without changing major plot points early introduction garp smart move obviously make changes would almost impossible cover much without making certain changes casting great everyone find one two character castings dont agree natural cant find real people look like anime every single time biggest disappointment arlong wasnt looking much like anime counterpart gone menacing look heavy cgi hope spend cgi justice characters introduced later watch anime read manga know crazy characters look cant design characters properly things go wrong quickly major issue character design arlong everything else pretty good overall nice start makes hopeful seasons fantastic live adaptation

The did it!!,"As a 20+ years fan of the series I was a bit sceptical when I first heard of the live action adaptation but they managed to capture the essence of One Piece! It looks and feels real. Well done to the production! With some foundations laid for coming seasons I hope they can bring this to a long running 10+ seasons (Wano Country and further)

Minor details such as the fact that Sanji's eyebrows is gone and replaced with a distaste for cilantro could work with his genetic modifications and hopefully Garp will tune in to his jovial and gregarious nature as we go further along.

So fun!,"I never could get into the original anime. I even tried watching it after I watched the 8 available episodes of the live action. The voices just don't fit. This version is what we didn't know we wanted. And now I want more. I love these characters, and the actors who play them. I wish I could meet them and hang out with them. Everything about this series is fun and exciting, just like playing pirate. Yes, some of the characters are a but daft, but, since it was originally a Manga or anime series, I only expect the craziest characters to appear. I really hope Netflix keeps this one going.

LOVED IT,"Coming from a huge fan of the One Piece Manga and Anime, I really enjoyed the live action. It can sometimes be very tough translating goofy/quirky anime characters into live action acting and I believe they have done a great job finding that balance while at the same time keeping true to some of Odas comedic art/storytelling style.

What really convinced me to give this a try is that Oda himself was behind it making sure it fit his vision even if things were a little different than the anime/manga. I am so glad he was able to bring out the different cultures into the main crew, something that can be diffcult to see in the anime/manga.

If I had the opportunity to alter or change a few things in the live action, it would have been the dialogue in Zoros past and a few of Luffy's lines that can come across a little cringy due only to the fault of this being a live action and not an anime.

Either way, my wife and I both loved it and really hope the adventure continues with Oda himself leading the helm.",02-Sep-23,10.0,coming huge fan one piece manga anime really enjoyed live action sometimes tough translating goofyquirky anime characters live action acting believe done great job finding balance time keeping true odas comedic artstorytelling style really convinced give try oda behind making sure fit vision even things little different animemanga glad able bring different cultures main crew something diffcult see animemanga opportunity alter change things live action would dialogue zoros past luffys lines come across little cringy due fault live action anime either way wife loved really hope adventure continues oda leading helm
Hoist the sails & kiss the gunners daughter,"The good: where to begin? The music is on point and adds to the story, the casting is good and the actors have good charisma together. The action scenes are decently choreographed. Typically over acting, CGI and cringe worth fights is significant in most action shows & movies these days. None of that is here. I was 200% shocked to see practical effects! In this day and age using prosthetics for the Fishmen? Really!?! Awesome! Flashback scenes give you a heads up when there is a time jump. The introduction of characters with a wanted poster doesn't get old and is funny by the reaction of the actor. I'm excited for season 2!

The bad: only complaint is Luffy's facial expressions in the first few episodes. They are kind of off putting, but after episode 3, he grew into the character. Other than that....zero complaints

Blow Away,"This was incredibly unexpected. It is probably the best thing Netflix will out out this year. The story, casting, and character development from this anime adaptation is perfect. You can feel the stories from all characters introduced and it just makes you feel like you always want more.

The story alone becomes more compelling with each progression in the series. The arcs are just a standard in anime but it leaves you wanting to watch the anime because who wants to wait for what happens next.

It just gets better from here,"One piece is the goofiest manga/anime in the world. It's absolutely crazy that they managed to make it into live action without making it cringe as it is absolutely the hardest anime to turn into live action.

There are some nitpicks, for example the camera work, i just couldn't understand why there was so many close up shots. I hope they make it more cinematic if they get a chance for season 2. Another issue was the costumes, like Nami's wigs, it really makes the show look cheap which isn't but overall it was REALLY A FUN watch.

I advice to not go and see this trying to compare it with the anime or the manga, it will never bee as good of course, but if you are a long time fan like me, or even a new fan, just enjoy the love and hard work that was put in this live adaptation and you will see past the small changes they made and really enjoy it.

Netflix put in the work this time to bring One Piece to life and it shows.,"I had every reason to believe that Netflix's One Piece adaptation would be a collossal piece of garbage. They have done nothing but give me reason after reason with their awful takes on Cowboy Bebop, and the Witcher to not trust them to do an adaptation properly, and just when I was completely done with them they go and pull off One Piece.

It makes no sense, but this is the wild and crazy world we live in.

Now granted, One Piece is actually impossible to adapt COMPLETELY to the live screen; anyone even casually familiar with the source material will understand that. But goddamn this show does as good of a job as can be reasonably expected to bring the world and characters to life.

The casting is great. These might be relatively newcomer actors, but they give the kinds of performances that make it look like they have been waiting their entire lives to bring these characters to life. I√±aki Godoy in particular gets a standing ovation from me for how close he nailed Luffy.

We get actual sets and make up and not just an overabundance of CGI which is a nice thing to see. The sets look great and thematic if not as grand as some of the locations in the manga, and the make up looks terrific even if, actually especially when it makes the villains look goofy and silly.

The writing and directing does an admirable job of not only adjusting the pace to make it fit in live action, which any One Piece fan could tell you was going to be a challenge, but also not shying away from the original style of the manga. There's a side by side comparison of one of the fights in the series, I wont say which one to keep this review spoiler free, that shows just how closely the choreography was being tailored to fit the action in the anime. I do still have some nitpicks about certain adjustments that don't seem to be neccessary but they're not major gripes as much as minor nitpicks.

All of my praise being said, this show still might not click for everyone. The subject matter is goofy and kind of cheesy at times, but hey it wouldn't be One Piece if it wasn't. It has a relatively familiar plot with predictable story themes even for people who have never experienced a Japanese shounen before. Those of us raised by the medium wouldn't have it any other way but for a live action audience looking for something new, the setting and premise of the show will feel new but the story beats and themes won't.

New to One Piece,"Just to be transparent. I have never watched any of the anime. I had heard about the live action version as I follow a lot of comic book and media outlets. There was a lot of speculation regarding how the show would be received by longtime fans of the anime so naturally I was curious.

I have to say I was sucked in right from the first episode and binged the first 5 episodes right then and there. I would have loved to have watched all 8 however work commitments did not allow that to happen. Needless to say, I finished the last 3 episodes the next day. As someone who went into this with no clue who the characters were I was constantly pulling up a wiki page to learn more about them at the end of each episode. Can I just say that the costume designer and makeup artists were on point with these characters from what I was referencing on the wiki. I loved seeing how much they all looked like their anime counterparts. Also, the straw hat crew actors were all so lovable and endearing. The story was great and made me want more episodes now to keep following on their adventures.

Even if you are not an anime fan I highly recommend giving this show the shot it deserves.

I couldn't stand the Anime,"This is amazing.

I really hated the anime. And never really got far. Because the whole cutesy overly enthusiastic vibe is just too much of a trope and I never thought it worked in anime. Ones accompanied by some really dark existential crisis kind of stuff.

In life action, though, The trope works really well The absurdity of it all in combination with a great adaptation of the art style.

I don't understand how the actors don't come over as bad actors with how overly theatrical everything is. Somehow this just makes everything better.

I normally skip allot because people like to waste time with letting shots linger on for 0 reason, the editing here feels unreadably snappy and every second of footage feels like takes part in telling a story.

The only thing that I didn't like is the matte painted facades in the opening shot.",14-Sep-23,9.0,amazing really hated anime never really got far whole cutesy overly enthusiastic vibe much trope never thought worked anime ones accompanied really dark existential crisis kind stuff life action though trope works really well absurdity combination great adaptation art style dont understand actors dont come bad actors overly theatrical everything somehow makes everything better normally skip allot people like waste time letting shots linger reason editing feels unreadably snappy every second footage feels like takes part telling story thing didnt like matte painted facades opening shot
A Pirate Saga,"I love One Piece the anime. And this one is exactly like that one but the live version, which is great. Kudos to the people who made this, top notch. And it will do fantastic, however I have a question which no one else seems to be asking. How exactly do you plan on continuing this series?

Let me explain, as of right now there are over 1000 episodes of the anime. Which means you have both the story and the character development to make the live version go on forever. And while that seems like a great idea there are lots of problems with that.

See real people age out of roles, like for example Luffy being a kid, that can only last a few seasons at best, as well as the rest of the crew. Then there's the Admiral getting up there in years, he's not getting any younger. See my point? The anime never has this problem because its cartoons, but a real life series has tons of these problems. Not to mention the fact that if you wanted to make even close to 1000 episodes it would take the rest of our lives and a couple of other lifetimes.

10/10 great cast, plot, everything's on point.",04-Sep-23,10.0,love one piece anime one exactly like one live version great kudos people made top notch fantastic however question one else seems asking exactly plan continuing series let explain right episodes anime means story character development make live version go forever seems like great idea lots problems see real people age roles like example luffy kid last seasons best well rest crew theres admiral getting years hes getting younger see point anime never problem cartoons real life series tons problems mention fact wanted make even close episodes would take rest lives couple lifetimes great cast plot everythings point
A way for non-anime watchers,"The live-action adaptation of One Piece provides a convenient option for those who may have limited time and aren't accustomed to watching anime. While not everyone has the luxury to invest in watching 1000 episodes, I, as a young teen, once did. It was one of my initial experiences with anime, and I find it fascinating to observe the distinctions between the two formats.

In the live-action rendition, they have incorporated elements from the original One Piece manga, which I believe was a commendable choice. However, I must admit that some of the alterations felt a bit peculiar, especially when comparing certain scenes to their anime counterparts. The Arlong fight, for instance, didn't quite live up to the excellence of the anime version in my opinion.

Nevertheless, on the whole, I appreciate their efforts in capturing the essential essence of the beloved anime and manga. The scenes involving Luffy and Nami, for instance, were remarkably emotional and even managed to bring a tear to my eye.",10-Sep-23,9.0,liveaction adaptation one piece provides convenient option may limited time arent accustomed watching anime everyone luxury invest watching episodes young teen one initial experiences anime find fascinating observe distinctions two formats liveaction rendition incorporated elements original one piece manga believe commendable choice however must admit alterations felt bit peculiar especially comparing certain scenes anime counterparts arlong fight instance didnt quite live excellence anime version opinion nevertheless whole appreciate efforts capturing essential essence beloved anime manga scenes involving luffy nami instance remarkably emotional even managed bring tear eye
"Perfect Casting, Superb Execution","I'll admit, I'm not the biggest One Piece fan. I have only seen a handful of episodes of the anime, but I know enough about the show to realize they could not have done any better picking the actors for these roles. Luffy is almost impossible because he is so grating and odd and awkward, but Inaki does his own rendition that translates perfectly. Emily and Mackenyu are perfect. Zoro's almost terminal indifference and aloofness is portrayed perfectly and Nami's guile and resilience really shine. Everybody else is great two, it's just that these three really stand out.

The show is pretty to look at, the sets are very nice and nothing looks cheap at all which is why it has me worried because Netflix will cancel it in a hurry unless a billion people watch it. I hope it gets another season. At least two more. I need to see what they do next because they have done a beautiful job so far.",10-Sep-23,8.0,ill admit im biggest one piece fan seen handful episodes anime know enough show realize could done better picking actors roles luffy almost impossible grating odd awkward inaki rendition translates perfectly emily mackenyu perfect zoros almost terminal indifference aloofness portrayed perfectly namis guile resilience really shine everybody else great two three really stand show pretty look sets nice nothing looks cheap worried netflix cancel hurry unless billion people watch hope gets another season least two need see next done beautiful job far
Adventure starts now,"The show starts great. Tries to stay true to the story. Some filler is skipped but some is added.

Acting is good by most characters though Nami let down it down a bit as it felt different from what we have seen in the anime or read in the manga.

In a World of Horrible Live Action Anime...,"I admit after having watched the entirety of the anime release so far, as a fan, I wasn't expecting much... that said, I've been really enjoying the new show! The acting was sometimes... not the best, and the changes made to the storyline were a little forced at times.

That said, the show is incredible compared to other live-action anime! I've been enjoying it, and will be continuing to watch!

Let's talk about the characters in the crew:

Luffy, played by I√±aki Godoy, captures the playful free-spirited character of the original Luffy. While I expected his accent to detract from the character. Once you've watched for a bit, the cognitive dissonance is easily ignored!

Nami, played by Emily Rudd, loses a bit of the anime's bodaciousness, but it adds in a character that is stronger than in the anime. Well done, and we approve.

Zoro, played by Mackenyu, adds a fun twist to the character with a slightly less abrasive demeanor. His acting conveys the emotional scars that the character has experienced very well, though sometimes the effort to emphasize how ""tough"" he is comes across as forced.

Usopp, played by Jacob Gibson, is richer than the anime made him out to be. His acting is great. Well done! He, frankly, is better than the anime's version! As a side note, they did cut the Usopp Pirates from syrup village. :-(

Sanji, played by Taz Skylar, cracks me up. He doesn't overplay the womanizer like in the anime. It makes it believeable and entertaining.

Now this is good stuff,"Man, I've been waiting for something like this. Very unique. I am not familiar with the original anime series. Just taking this on its own. Great characters, excellent acting. Fun and exciting at the same time. Honestly, I would have given it a 10, but I have never given anything a 10. It will have to be the perfect movie/series. This has just the right mix of quirkiness, humor, action, and character development.

Im so happy,"They broke the Curse. They did it. I can't even believe it. Im a One Piece die hard fan for over 15 years and I loved this. Ep 3 and 4 were a little weak, but the rest was pure gold.

A fun show,"What a surprisingly fun show. Having watched only about fifty of the anime episodes, this is a great adaptation. The characters are cast as they are in the anime, which is a breath of fresh air. Not only that, these actors nail their roles. Not only do they look but they play the part. It's a beautiful looking show. The colors and sets are so nice to watch. Some of the earlier episodes seem a bit dark visually though, but it gets better. While it is a fun show, it does leave a few things out, and changes some things, which leaves me from giving it a perfect rating.

Something I wasn't a fan of, was the show skipping some what I feel are important parts of the anime that I feel would've added more depth and emotion. The ship restaurant with Sanji is an example. I also am not of fan of Netflix making Arlong and his pirates be some oppressed group and claiming they are slaves to people. None of this is said or resembled in the anime, and feels something an American show would want to include, and feels very cheap and overused. A small thing I also am not a fan of is not having Sanji with a cigarette in his mouth the majority of the time like in the anime. Apparently this was to give it a more inclusive rating, but that little detail is such a big part of the character.

All in all a fun show I recommend.",10-Sep-23,9.0,surprisingly fun show watched fifty anime episodes great adaptation characters cast anime breath fresh air actors nail roles look play part beautiful looking show colors sets nice watch earlier episodes seem bit dark visually though gets better fun show leave things changes things leaves giving perfect rating something wasnt fan show skipping feel important parts anime feel wouldve added depth emotion ship restaurant sanji example also fan netflix making arlong pirates oppressed group claiming slaves people none said resembled anime feels something american show would want include feels cheap overused small thing also fan sanji cigarette mouth majority time like anime apparently give inclusive rating little detail big part character fun show recommend
so far so good,"I have been watching the one piece cartoon for more than 16 years and the series is a good memory of my childhood. In total, the series give us a brief and short conclusion of the childhood life of every early member from the Luffy's group. In contrast with cartoon the series is really pragmatic and brief, and that's what I love this serious most.

Wow. I can't believe how enjoyable this is.,"I didn't know what I was expecting but it wasn't this. I had very low expectations. But WOW, was I surprised.

This is EXACTLY how to interpret Asian cartoon/comics into live action. The depth of the characters and their willingness and ability to carry out what could be seen as silly with seriousness is great.

The entire cast exudes empathy for all that they they have learned through the pain of their childhoods.

They do more than just pull it off. They excel at it. The characters pull you in and make you root for them. The direction is amazing and the production value is wonderful.

One piece live action,It was very well done and it left me wanting more because it had the same weight as the anime/manga but it told the story in a little bit of a different view/perspective. The actors were the best pick for every character. The pacing was very well done compared to the anime but even though they cut some stuff out it felt original and the same at the same time. And hopefully this will bring new fans to the great world of one piece. This is definitely the best anime live action adaptation ever. The cgi was a lot better than I expected and it was just a really nice treat to watch and enjoy.

Awesome!!!,"Even though some part of the stories are different from the manga or anime, they are still great!! Looks more realistic and natural as well. Makes the audiences who have even read the manga or watched the anime before curious about how the stories gonna flow going forward.

All the casts are amazing and so into the characters they are playing!! Some small details like the small habitual movement of the characters are also on point and executed well in the movie (heroes or villains).

The cinematography, settings and tones are great too!! Honestly they are beyond my expectation compared to other live action.

HATERS WILL ALWAYS HATE,"HATERS There are many types of haters in this Live action of ONE Piece

number 1 is the OTHER ANIME LOVER the one that loves naruto, demon slayer, Aot, etc. They need to hate or blow some else's candle to make their anime shine and better in their perspective. People hate them because there is something that is much better than them. Come on guys, grow up. As an anime lover that loves One Piece, Naruto, AOT, to demon slayer to any other new anime. You need to clap and see the best in something. Rating a 1 really? Don't make me laugh. It seems you don't know anything about the production, the cinematography is lit, the props and costumes, the CGI, the characters, the effort and the acting. I know there is a lot of room for improvement. You won't get it on your first time. These perfect people who judge and need everything to be perfect.

AND FOR THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE ACTING AND THE CAST. What do you want? An S class actor like Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Leonardo? What a stupid mindset. If presume you can't even introduce yourself properly. How much more when acting and saying cringy lines HAHAHA

Want a one of one ratio for the animr and live action? I hate to break it up for you but it's never going to happen since this is a fictional story. And the amount of effort that needs to put is massive.

This Was So Good!,"I'll preface this by saying that I've never seen the anime nor have I read the manga. The only thing I knew about One Piece was stuff my brother, who's a huge fan, has told me. I kept saying that I'll just watch the live action when it comes out since over a thousand episodes is a lot and OH MY GOD was it worth it. The comedy really landed but so did the serious moments. I'm a pretty big crier so I cried almost every episode, which is still crazy. The CGI was honestly incredibly impressive and the fight scenes were so fun to watch! My favorite thing, though, was the camera work, shots and framing, simply beautiful. The first couple episodes have a lot of close up which I LOVE. I watched the first four episodes with my brother and mom who are both big fans and they also really enjoyed it. They mentioned some storylines that were cut for time but, as someone who came in with fresh eyes, I don't think it negatively impacted the story a lot. The character intros were so good too. Right off the bat, you know who the character is, what role they will play in the story, and whether they're friend or foe. Again, the emotional scenes really work for me and the acting makes it that much more impactful. This isn't a spoiler but there is a scene at the end that is a big turning point before what is, essentially, the final fight and god damn is it good. All the flashbacks also do get the emotions flowing. The last little montage of characters reappearing also got me emotional. There is a character that we see a lot in the first two episodes and then not again that reappears at the end and it got me emotional. I can't wait to see what they do if they, hopefully, get a second season. I can't wait.

They did it,"A brilliant retelling of the legendary manga, the One Piece live action is beautifully done and elevates the source material due to the respect, care and hard work that went into it. As someone who's been reading One Piece religiously for the last 18 years, I can't help but feel great pride that against all odds, One Piece was the show that finally broke the Hollywood anime => live action curse. There was so many things that could have gone wrong, yet they managed to strike the perfect balance of goofiness, seriousness, humour, action and emotion. With its outstanding acting and casting (Nami and Buggy performances really stood out to me), epic soundtrack, fantastic set and costume design (The Baratie was an absolute treat, and all the costumes felt like real clothes), amazing choreographies and solid visual effects (Zoro swords fights were incredible), both fans and newcomers will have the absolute best time watching this 8 episode and (re)discovering the East Blue saga, and will crave more.

WE ARE.....WAITING FOR SEASON 2!,"STORY, DIRECTING, ACTING, PRODUCTION DESIGN, CINEMATOGRAPHY, CHOREOGRAPHY, SETTING. Almost every aspect of what makes a good show a ""GREAT SHOW"" were seen and established perfectly in the show. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST LIVE-ADAPTATION OF AN ANIME EVER MADE!

Some constructive criticism though. I'm giving it only an 8/10 rating just because for me, the CASTING aspect of the film was great but some of the casting choices were not done justice at all. Specifically, Benn Beckman and Makino. Another thing are the wigs specifically of Nami and Shanks. I was hoping they could have done better.

Overall, I am so happy for the output of this show. The little tweaks in the storyline was established amazingly and it fits perfectly. I felt that they really did put the time and effort for it to have an amazing outcome. Kudos to the production team and WE ARE! Waiting for the Season 2 of this.

One Piece is real!,"I was one of the many who had very low expectations as live action animes don't have the greatest track of success and capturing the magic that Oda Sensai has created would be one of the most difficult tasks every and how they would present the story in 8 episodes was also questionable.

A Fantastic Unique Show,"This show has been a worldwide phenomenon the last few weeks and I have now watched the live action version of One Piece. I have never watched the animated version of the show so I am going in blind and here is my review for it. The premise of the show sees a group of pirates come together in order to attempt to look for a long lost treasure.

Main Character Inaki Godoy plays Monkey D Luffy and he is a great lead character here. He is a lot of fun and he is so energetic that you can't help yourself but become interested in him. Sometimes it can be a bit much but overall I really liked Luffy and felt like this was a genuine performance. There is some development here for sure and this is a fun lead performance.

Supporting Characters The best character on this show is Zoro played by Mackenyu. He is an awesome character and is easily the best part of the action sequences, his sword play is ridiculously entertaining and his deadpan comedy really worked for me.

Emily Rudd plays Nami and she is a good character too, she is a focal point of the show and her character gets time to shine. There are flashbacks about her that explains the more mysterious parts of her character and along with Luffy & Zoro are a great trio of characters.

Garp played by Vincent Regan is a great antagonist, he is the vice admiral of the marines and is trying to eradicate piracy, in particular Luffy. He is a nuanced character and there is more to him then some moustache twiddling bad guy.

There are so many other great performances that I will just say that everybody is great and I had a fun time seeing them all do their thing and clearly care about their characters.

Story The story is great, it especially does a fantastic job in building up the main characters and building this whole universe up. It has the pirates story and the marines story and I thought both were great and linked to each other very well. It is also great at having individual stories in the episodes while having a larger narrative. The finale really delivers and sets up a bright future for live action One Piece.

Script This show delivers with some dramatic moments and some genuinely funny moments. The chemistry and delivery is pretty spot on by all the performers. However, this show does get a little too cheesy and ridiculous for me. The show thrives on being over the top but there are a few moments where it took me out of the show.

Style This show looks amazing. It is full of colour and brightness and I love some of the designs here, whether that be costumes, locations or weapons and it all nailed it. The pacing of the show is fantastic and each episode did a great job in introducing and developing multiple characters on this show.

Overall Overall, One Piece is a fantastic show, It looks amazing and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I recommend that everybody watches it, especially those who are fans of fantasy shows as this is one of the better ones of the last few years.

Best live action anime adaptation,"Now realistically I wanna say this was a 7.5/10. It was fun and enjoyable, funny at times and made you care about the characters, the fights were surprisingly pretty entertaining and well made too. The problems I have are only a few small details like how some small side characters are wrote off, the acting with some characters is a lot better then others, and I didn't like how they showed so much of garp so early in the story. But nonetheless it didn't ruin the show for me and was still pretty enjoyable and entertaining throughout the whole season.

First Live Action That's Amazing!,"I've seen the anime and I've seen this entire S1 Netflix series now and I have never seen a live action done amazing until now. Seriously, live actions get so much hate because they're just devoid of the passion behind animes. This one though, that passion is there down to the most minute details. From casting, to acting, to staying largely true to the story, to, yes, even the CG, everything is done excellently. Imo Arlong was probably the only one I was like visually ehh about, but the actor had the personality DOWN. I am so glad they kept the core and passion of One Piece in this & that has made ALL the difference. I wish more adaptations were up to this par and I definitely think this live action adaptation has finally set the bar that fans expect.

I also feel like they've done an EXCELLENT job of compacting the series the way that they have and I don't feel like they've skipped over anything really important, which just proves how much dedication they have to this series.

They got it right!!!!,"I'm a long time dedicated fan of the anime and previous attempts to make a live action version of an anime have typically failed tragically. I was genuinely concerned that this show would fall afoul of the same things that made those other shows fail and was perhaps braced for the worst. One Piece is my favourite anime and is unique even by anime standards and the bar it had to meet was high for me. However, almost unbelievably, they got it right!!! From the characters to the overarching plot they have finally pulled off a live action version of an anime. The characters are perfect representations for their anime counterparts, (give Luffy a chance because he WILL grow on you) there were one or two moments that have been streamlined but ultimately the plot and the characters remain faithful to the anime.

Very entertaining. Good watch!,"A good 8.2/10 at least for me. Like many people, I was a little skeptical about this series, but ultimately it was a nice surprise.

Let's be honest, it was quite a challenge to make a good series with ''real people'' based on the one piece anime. In fact, it must be a challenge to do that with any animes. We have seen several phenomenal flops in the past. But One Piece succeeded. I've seen Naruto, Bleach but I haven't seen One Piece yet. I really like the universe, the pirates, the marine, the different characters.

The actors are good, the characters are interesting and their story is interesting too. I must admit that I have a crush on the actress Emily Rudd. We feel the anime side, the dialogues of the characters which are sometimes cheesy but still get to our emotions or I don't know how to say it. We feel attached to most characters.

It's not the masterpiece of the century either, but frankly I really like it, I have fun watching this series and I recommend it!",12-Sep-23,8.0,good least like many people little skeptical series ultimately nice surprise lets honest quite challenge make good series real people based one piece anime fact must challenge animes seen several phenomenal flops past one piece succeeded ive seen naruto bleach havent seen one piece yet really like universe pirates marine different characters actors good characters interesting story interesting must admit crush actress emily rudd feel anime side dialogues characters sometimes cheesy still get emotions dont know say feel attached characters masterpiece century either frankly really like fun watching series recommend
What felt natural in anime feels forced here,"A lot of users will make this into a must watch show just because they liked the manga or anime. But this show is probably worse than cowboy bebop.

Firstly, Relationships feel forced, comic relief cast seems annoying. Never in my life have i seen a show where so little emotion came out of the cast. Its basically one guy, who was supposed to be funny, shouting nonsense. It was funny in the anime but here just looks bad and out of context most of the time. Crew apperance is not even accurate. Ussop is supposed to be this funny looking guy with a long nose, that no one would like but tells good jokes. Here one can argue that he the is the best looking cast. So the main comic relief is gone. Zoro the goofy swordsman is the all time angry looking guy. Zoro sanji relationship also was pretty bad. The vice admiral that is supposed to be a goofy guy now all of a sudden is always serious.

The luffy family tree reveal that should have happened later down the line, happens quite quickly. The order of things is all wrong. And then i am not sure why so much focus was given to cobey character when his acting and scense make you wanna fast forward so badly. Islands with no marine presence now all of a sudden has marines everywhere.

CGI is basic nothing too fancy considering the budget. If you wanna get into this story, go watch the anime.

You can't stop watching,"I've considered watching one piece a couple of years ago, but after I found out it was a 1000+ episodes, I gave up on the idea. So I can't say if it's true to the original, but what I can surely say is that I couldn't stop watching it, smiling like a kid. I believe the actors really did their best to embody these characters, especially Inaki Godoy. It was a pleasure seeing him portray Luffy. Props to everyone who worked on this project and managed to break the so-called 'curse' in the anime live action adaptations and let's just hope that Netflix will be kind enough to not cancel this show, but instead, give it a second season.

Unacceptable for something I pay,"The technical quality of this show is simply unacceptable.

I could accept what I'm seeing if it was a passion project done by a group of friends with limited budget, but not from a hnudred+ millions dollar production.

In every wide shot you can see they're shooting in modern cities, they didn't even bother removing the modern building with VFX, it just takes you out of the story immediately because I can't possibly believe that's the One Piece world.when it looks like my neighbourhood (in case you're wondering yes, I'm Italian).

How they plan to do the most challenging shots of the show is beyond me when they can't even make a halfdecent looking Loguetown.

Remember the quality you saw in the first seasons of Game of Thrones? Well, those apparently had LESS BUDGET than this trainwrec but it had great wide shots of medival cities, castles, fortresses, etc.

Apart from that:
The sets look like cheap adventure rides from a them park.



The CGI in general is a joke, again I don't see where hundreds of millions of dollars ended up
The fights are laughable, you can see exactly how the actors were attached to the wires by how they move, it looks awful and simply doesn't make justice to the anime.



The plot is rushed. It was predictable that this would happen when you try to condensate tens of episodes into 8, and it happened.



You can see that some of the actors really believed in this project, unfortunately most of them just look like cheap cosplays.


Summing up, this is another Cowboy Bebop, maybe even worse than that.

Absolutely nailed it!,"The actors, the characters, the story and the morality of it all is spot on!

I went in and found myself immersed with Luffy instantly, I don't think they could have found a better actor for this, he has the expressions and the magic perfectly translated from the anime series.

All of the actors are doing a great job, it's cheesy like it should be, but nicely tuned down to film material without compromising too much!

I don't usually get this pleasantly surprised by new movies and especially not series nowadays, so I am thrilled to see they did so well with this.

Just looking forward to season 2 now.

Faithful to the first 45 episodes of the anime.,"I didn't expect much and was pleasantly surprised. Episodes to date faithfully recreate the first 45 or so episodes of the anime series. That is a real testament to the writers. Just about another 1000 to go! I'm only up to episode 500 or so myself but am still working on it.

All aspects of the production and acting were very well done, especially the cgi special effects. In fact, the casting was superbly done, each actor faithfully rendering their character to perfection.

This series won't appeal to everyone, especially those that don't appreciate silliness in their entertainment, but it will appeal to fans of the original anime and others. Very good slapstick entertainment. Highly recommended.",08-Sep-23,8.0,didnt expect much pleasantly surprised episodes date faithfully recreate first episodes anime series real testament writers another go im episode still working aspects production acting well done especially cgi special effects fact casting superbly done actor faithfully rendering character perfection series wont appeal everyone especially dont appreciate silliness entertainment appeal fans original anime others good slapstick entertainment highly recommended
another Netflix Failure,"The Netflix live adaptation of ""One Piece"" feels drab, forced and doesn't manage to capture ANY of the feeling you had reading the manga by Eiichiro Oda or watching the original anime. The CGI is horribly shoddy, out of touch, and looks like it was made by the same people who worked on ""The Witcher"". Comparatively speaking, the CGI on the ""The Pirates of The Caribbeans"" movies that came out two decades ago is leagues above this. The action scenes don't feel realistic whatsoever, in fact, the characters look like they are performing dances or acting out the scenes on a stage rather than actually engaging in combat. At points it seems like it would be more natural for the characters to actually break into a musical than hit each other.

Unexpectedly pleasant,"I have watched 200 episodes of One piece anime and this series covered 100 barely, so I am very well qualified. In one word, it was unexpectedly pleasant. I loved how they have picturized some of the iconic scenes, all the origin stories remained the same and were beautifully portrayed but not as detailed as we have seen in the anime, but well in 8 hours, I guess this is the best one can do. I was a tad disappointed with the background score because the original one has nailed it in every fight. There are a lot of storyline changes made in the name of creative liberty which mingles with the story well too, so even that worked out. Oda being an executive producer made his mark indeed and you will see that the main plot remains the same, it was just given a bit more humane touch and can be considered a good start to start your one piece anime journey.",02-Sep-23,8.0,watched episodes one piece anime series covered barely well qualified one word unexpectedly pleasant loved picturized iconic scenes origin stories remained beautifully portrayed detailed seen anime well hours guess best one tad disappointed background score original one nailed every fight lot storyline changes made name creative liberty mingles story well even worked oda executive producer made mark indeed see main plot remains given bit humane touch considered good start start one piece anime journey
Well...,"Normally I hate live adaptation animes but this one was in point.

Don't take me wrong they are things that I would like to change also, like Beck Beckman, a little bit Arlong but all and all was great casting especially in the strawhats which was very good and the actors wanted to be part of this, you see it every moment that accept that they like it, they enjoy it too also.

The only main problem with it was that the story is so huge that is difficult to cover it that's why they cut a lot of the things which is understandable but also not good at the same time. Probably they wanted to save time.

Good,"The latest hotly anticipated live action adaptation by Netflix, and I must say it was very good. Having only seen around 1/10th of the anime series at the time of writing, that may not seem like a lot, but for those that know even that much is some level of dedication. Being a fan of the original, but acknowledging most previous attempts at an adaptation of an animation, I was sceptical, but the show lives up to any of the expectations you could hope for, and even generally surpasses them. Following Monkey D. Luffy, a young strawhat wearing pirate on an adventure to find the One Piece, a mythical treasure left by the last King of the Pirates, as he assembles his crew and meets many enemies along the way. The set pieces were incredibly impressive all around, most CGI is suitable, and the writing is quite good; it sticks to the source very strongly. The costuming is also quite good, they really keep all the silliness of the manga / anime that most live actions would strip out, from the slug-based telephones to ridiculous hairdos, it works and pays respect to the source in a powerful way. The casting was perfect, and acting decent, a few side characters were meh, but also at only one season we've barely introduced much of a plot yet. The fight scenes were all great, and I generally had a good time throughout. If you have seen the original, then of course, you'll likely love this, if you haven't, it would probably be a better experience if you had and some of the plot may seem very strange, but its definitely not required. I dare not say anything negative about it else Netflix will hear me and cancel it, so with that I highly recommend.",05-Sep-23,7.0,latest hotly anticipated live action adaptation netflix must say good seen around th anime series time writing may seem like lot know even much level dedication fan original acknowledging previous attempts adaptation animation sceptical show lives expectations could hope even generally surpasses following monkey luffy young strawhat wearing pirate adventure find one piece mythical treasure left last king pirates assembles crew meets many enemies along way set pieces incredibly impressive around cgi suitable writing quite good sticks source strongly costuming also quite good really keep silliness manga anime live actions would strip slugbased telephones ridiculous hairdos works pays respect source powerful way casting perfect acting decent side characters meh also one season weve barely introduced much plot yet fight scenes great generally good time throughout seen original course youll likely love havent would probably better experience plot may seem strange definitely required dare say anything negative else netflix hear cancel highly recommend
What A Show!,"Sooo since 2012, I've been watching the anime OP, I had several times of rewatch of this anime. For putting it on a live action it seems like impossible since there were some exaggerated action that cannot be done in live action. But seeing the first season it makes my chilhood complete from manga, anime now a live action.

You should know by now we cannot compare the anime vs live action but what the story on it and how do they portray the character that made by Mr. Oda.

The weird thing for me now is hearing the english dub, but no harm you can change it to the japanese or other language as fits on you.

Butchered...,"Characters do not completely look the part, such as Luffy's scar being barely visible. Nami's hair should be a more natural red color, and Sanji just has blonde highlights for some reason. There is also a point when Luffy says he is not hungry, which is out of character for him. To be spoiler free, I will avoid specifics, but they skip a whole boss fight and nix a whole sub-boss, and both relocate and reduce the scale of two other boss fights/sub-boss fights. For what?

Goofy and exciting adventure. Lots to love,"I've never watched the anime or read the manga. This is my first time and I like it.

The main cast is great, the male lead is perfect.

Usually anime live actions series or movies have very cheap costumes. They usually look plastic or cosplay. This series is decent and better than most. The very first scence with Roger every one looked cosplayed. But after that, it pretty good. The costume for the lead is perfect. I think the wig is a big factor in Anime adaptation, making it feel organic requires attention to details. Good work on the team.

Action pose in Anime is hard to replicate in real life while making it practical. They did a great job with Zorro for fighting with 3 swords. They did an excellent job with other characters too, like the greatest swordsmen, some of the pose and shot are excellent, looks very anime like and great.

I really like the series, fantastic music, great choreography, great staging set, a great cast, the clown is awesome. Great work on teying to make the costume looks organic. Story progress very quickly and lots of surprises along the way.

A surprisingly well-done adaptation,"I had my worries that they'd butcher another one of the most successful franchises, but so far I am very much positively surprised. The cast works, the story is condensed and cohesive, the setting is intriguing. I am very very surprised by how well they put everything off.

Still, now what is lacking: The cinematography is off; too much fish lense, almost every scene is close-up, which does give a weird vibe to the universe itself. Some wider shots would greatly benefit the entire feel of the universe. I'd also wish they'd take up more songs (!!!) and jokes (!!) from the original manga into the series - sometimes it just doesn't feel silly OR impactful enough, and I don't get why they would abandon those. Zoros fight against Mihawk is the prime example - this one needed a lot more pathos: The pace needs more variation.

The potential of this adaptation is really enormous. I can't wait for it to thrive and become more refined. I think this might be a really great series.",31-Aug-23,7.0,worries theyd butcher another one successful franchises far much positively surprised cast works story condensed cohesive setting intriguing surprised well put everything still lacking cinematography much fish lense almost every scene closeup give weird vibe universe wider shots would greatly benefit entire feel universe id also wish theyd take songs jokes original manga series sometimes doesnt feel silly impactful enough dont get would abandon zoros fight mihawk prime example one needed lot pathos pace needs variation potential adaptation really enormous cant wait thrive become refined think might really great series

Live action curse breaker,"You can't go into live actions expecting an exact translation of the manga or anime. It's a very condensed version of the source material but they do it in the right way. They smashed all the important scenes out of the park while still leaving in a-lot of the funny / wholesome scenes which really makes One Piece what it is. Amazing cast of actors not only acting wise but they all fit the characters they play perfectly, great fight scenes, amazing vfx and cgi. Great script, not corny. Surprisingly more graphic than I expected (good thing). Overall you still get the feel of One Piece watching this.

This is so far the best live adaptation of an anime,"I've been a fan of anime and manga for years. I've seen many. Most of my favorites were from the 90s like Akira, Ninja Scroll, Wicked City etc... There were lots of crazy ones back then. Then in the 2000s Cowboy Bebop, Kenshin, Trigun, and eventually Naruto became very popular. I had heard of One Piece for quite some time, but when it came to America it was on Nickelodeon and looked ridiculous. Apparently it was censored for American audiences. As a result one of the pirates always sucked on a Lolli pop. It wasn't till later that I found out that character always smoked cigarettes, but they didn't want American kids to see that. All of the blood and many other things were censored. It wasn't till a couple years ago I started to watch it when the anime was available on Netflix. I completely fell in love with it. Although I haven't reached the 1000th episode of the anime, I've gotten quite far. I watched several episodes of the live adaptation of this, and wow... I can't say enough. This is by far the best live anime adaptation I've seen. Each of the actors act exactly like their manga characters. I've watched Dragon Ball, Kenshin, and Cowboy Bebop live adaptations and this one really blows them away. If you are a one piece fan, you really have to watch the live adaptation.

Not the funny One Piece but a Serious one.,"I am a huge fan of one piece. Especially the funny side of one piece. Every character in one piece manage to bring the smile on my face.

"As a manga and anime adaptation, it is alright","It is pretty amazing what they were able to produce. It is not perfect but it is certainly not bad, considering the original work's whimsical characters and story beats.

As another reviewer said, they did some changes to the story's beat. Some are alright, some kinda erased the strong moments. (Like the Sanji's chapter erased a lot of my favourite moments - like Sanji crying out to Zoro to throw his dreams away and how unfaltered Luffy's confiction was even when facing death. Those were some iconic moments that I felt build the foundation of One Piece even more.)

The casts were great though. They did some really heavy lifting in making these characters alive. I am a big fan of buggy in this series. He is great and a very handsome actor underneath all those make up.

I think the action could be better... I know it is hard to translate the manga and anime scene into live action but it felt very basic. Luffy's punch felt weak and he doesn't feel as strong as his manga/anime counterpart. But Inaki is very inspiring as Luffy. He is great as Luffy.

A series with a lot of heart,"First of all, I'm writing this review as someone who loves the anime genre but never watched the original One Piece show. So, I cannot judge how well the story transitioned into live-action. My review will be on the series as a stand-alone piece of media.

I loved the good vibes in the series so much, it's a breath of fresh air in a landscape filled with hate.

The world building can throw you off a bit, mixing the old and the modern, but by the end of the first episode you understand its mechanics.

Casting and character writing is top-notch. Everyone feels like their own self, with their own desires and their own quirks. And the main characters are given the space to grow. The story acknowledges they are still young and inexperienced, they face all sorts of much powerful enemies and they have to be creative to get out of those situations.

If you don't like watching anime, chances are you'll find One Piece childish and weird. But if you are like me, and grew up with this sort of stories, you'll enjoy every minute of it.",11-Sep-23,10.0,first im writing review someone loves anime genre never watched original one piece show cannot judge well story transitioned liveaction review series standalone piece media loved good vibes series much breath fresh air landscape filled hate world building throw bit mixing old modern end first episode understand mechanics casting character writing topnotch everyone feels like self desires quirks main characters given space grow story acknowledges still young inexperienced face sorts much powerful enemies creative get situations dont like watching anime chances youll find one piece childish weird like grew sort stories youll enjoy every minute
AMAZING ADAPTATION OF THE ANIME!!,"Not gonna lie, when I saw the trailer for the One Piece TV series I wasn't too excited by what I saw. Maybe it was just me who was used of how the anime looked like that made it feel off for me.

The story isn't as long compared to the anime but they are done amazingly well! The action is very well choreographed.

A pleasant surprise,"The series contradics my deepest concerns in the best way possible.

It has been about 12 years since I abandoned the world of One Piece. I spent hours reading the manga, following the adventure of Luffy and co and was always eager for my next birthday when I would receive the next volume of this unhinged and colorful world.

Like many, I was somewhat flabbergasted to hear that a LIVE ACTION One Piece series was about to be released and I quickly beacme sceptical. The surreal content of the manga/anime was something I never thought could be translated into a real medium. My scepsism grew further with the idea that alot of half measures and deviations from the original content may have been made to fit the series to a broader audience. I didn't have much of an interest in this show and wasn't planning on watching it. But curiosity and memories got the better of me and I am overjoyed for it.

Thankfully, my suspicions were proved wrong from the first 2 episodes alone. The story is almost identical to the manga(with a few alterations to keep a decent flow) down to details such as clothes, hair color and most importantly character personalities. The actors manage to convey the personas of the characters in a manner that is not immoderate and at the same time a genuine homage to the original story. Even my mother who only watches Scandinavian crime shows found humor and emotion in Luffys frivolity and his relationship with mentor Shanks, Zorros stoicism and Namis resourcefulness. While one hour episodes may seem long, they elapse quickly thanks to a brilliant pace(episode 2 juggled between past and present masterfully, something many shows fail with), witty writing and a unique outlook that I believe old fans and newcomers alike will enjoy.

9/10 for the first couple of episodes. The show is suprisingly good with a great balance between action, humor and emotion.

a spectacular adaptation,"This is must watch i've watches anime and read manga and still, watching his was a rollercoaster. This series showed a lot of off camera things too like mihawk destroying don krieg. We saw garp contacting mihawk which wasn't shown in anime. It was just a different take than the anime. It was also quiet fast paces and covered like 80 episodes(1600 minnutes) in 8 episodes(480 minnutes). Mihawk seemed straight out of anime and was pure perfection. Within first 3 episodes, i was in love with nami and luffy.

Stll, some things were questionable. To list them, 1. Shanks was quiet different, altough he grew on me quickly and now he is one of my favs 2. The iconic scene of shanks handing down the straw hat and holding luffy in water, didn't seem as iconic as in manga and anime(i still won't call it bad as it was quiet cool but if you start to compare it, the anime definately did better) 3.garp wasn't portrayed as the legend of marines like in the anime and it wasn't cool untill the last episode 4. Sanji's farewell from baratie wasn't as emotional

It's just not OP,"The charm of OP is just not there. The characters are overly broody. So much of the comedy of the original story is replaced with long, drawn out action scenes when the original story already had plenty of action. While it would be expected that some of the original story would need to be condensed, soo many of the changes made were not for that reason. The show feels bloated with new story that either takes place later in the series or doesn't exist in the first place.

The characters are changed quite dramatically. Zoro come across as pompous and arrogant while ditching his swordsman creed. Luffy feels even more infantile in this depiction than he does in the original while completely missing that super human willpower to protect his friends. Nami, one of the strongest female characters ever written, the original true captain of the straw hat pirates, is replaced by a generic modern ""girl boss"".

The fights are sad and pathetic, with the entire straw hat crew frequently ganging up on the main bad guy rather than the hallmark 1 on 1 fights the original story is known for. I understand the need to condense the story but that could have been done by showing many of the fight scenes concurrently as part of a larger battle rather than omitting much of the 1v1 fight scenes.

I stopped watching after the second episode as that was all butchery of one of my favorite shows that I could tolerate.

I will say that overall the aesthetic of one piece is there, the production quality is adequate and I think the actors definitely looked the part. Which is why I am giving it 3 stars instead of 1. However the writters and directors fail miserably.",31-Aug-23,3.0,charm op characters overly broody much comedy original story replaced long drawn action scenes original story already plenty action would expected original story would need condensed soo many changes made reason show feels bloated new story either takes place later series doesnt exist first place characters changed quite dramatically zoro come across pompous arrogant ditching swordsman creed luffy feels even infantile depiction original completely missing super human willpower protect friends nami one strongest female characters ever written original true captain straw hat pirates replaced generic modern girl boss fights sad pathetic entire straw hat crew frequently ganging main bad guy rather hallmark fights original story known understand need condense story could done showing many fight scenes concurrently part larger battle rather omitting much v fight scenes stopped watching second episode butchery one favorite shows could tolerate say overall aesthetic one piece production quality adequate think actors definitely looked part giving stars instead however writters directors fail miserably
Wow..,"Had very low expectations, after seeing how Cowboy Bebob turned out I thought this would be another wasted hype train but I'm truly impressed and humbled.

One piece takes place in such a unique universe with it's own set of rules, and to some extent laws of physics that I had feared they would have made the series more realistic and grounded in our reality because I struggled to see how it could work in live action, but I have no idea why but the cartoon-like physics, and even such a small detail like the snail based communication technology and the seagull newspaper delivery with their little hats just works somehow.

Sanji my favorite character growing up was absolutely amazing, very happy he's actually smoking instead of having a lollipop in his mouth, anything else would be betraying his character. He's still the definition of cool like I thought he was when I was 12.

Luffy was great, the perfect blend of naivet√© and seriousness. Reminds me a lot of how I imagine Goku from dragon ball should be done in live action, a slightly naive guy with a heart of gold and overflowing with determination and confidence.

Usopp was amazing as well, although his constant lying hits different in live action somehow, maybe because he is missing his pinnochio nose? But still the casting couldn't have been better.

Nami was incredible as well, she's just as I imagined her as being. The actress did an amazing job.

Zorro was probably the hardest one for me to get used to though, not sure why but I think it might be his hair, I just don't believe Zorro is the kind of person who would dye his hair, and unlike other characters with unnatural colored hair(by our universe's standards) you could see his hair was dyed instead of being all the way through like Nami's sister or other characters.

While that being said I still felt the actor did an incredible job - really if all I have to criticize is his hair, he did amazingly.

But all in all this was a trip and strangely both a breath of fresh air and a nostalgic rendezvous, I'm happy to see my childhood be recreated in such a spectacular fashion.

Oh and the pacing was top notch too.

Best Show In 2023,"Please don't listen to the haters, you can see how they went hardly fathom the immense effort that must have gone into this project - the meticulous casting of actors, the choice of locations, and every detail crafted to perfection. The actors, in my eyes, appeared to be born for their roles. However, I do have concerns that some viewers may not embrace it fully due to comparisons with the anime. It's essential to recognize that anime and live-action adaptations can't mirror each other precisely because human actors aren't as adaptable as their animated counterparts. In my opinion, we should celebrate these emerging adaptations, as they bring our imaginations to life.

Very well executed. Worth watching.,"I'm not sure where to start because words alone can't capture my admiration for 'OPLA.' It has exceeded all my expectations. From the Casting, Set pieces, Ship designs, Costumes, Location, Action choreography, BGM, Actors performance and direction; it lived upto every aspect.

The story is fast paced, preventing any moments of boredom. I particularly appreciate the fresh take on the story, avoiding any sense of repetition. My personal favorite aspect is the 'non-linear storytelling method,' which kept me fully engaged. I also loved crew's personal interactions , which you don't usually get in the manga or anime these days. And Garp-Koby relationship development alongside the main story, that's cherry on the top.

I could keep talking about 'OPLA,' but there's so much to say. I just want to thank the creators for giving us such an amazing live-action adventure. What great time to be a One Piece fan!

Exceeded expectations!,"Since this was a live action adaptation of anime, I didn't expect that much, since it hasn't worked out well in the past. But Netflix finally broke the curse, this is pretty well made. I had only watched first few episodes of the original anime so not sure how close this is, but I have watched many other Animes, so my opinion comes based on that. Casting of all characters is really good. It was kind of addicting, binged watched the whole thing. Each episode feels like a movie of its own, pretty good VFX. Great that they didn't mess it up like Death Note. From what I have got to know from others, there has been lots of cuts as compared to anime. But I guess that might have been necessary to keep the attention of viewers, otherwise some arcs can really feel too long.

The best Manga/anime adaptation of all time,"Honestly saying adapting peak fiction like One piece in live action is almost imposible not to mention what kinda anime/manga adaptaion history we've.

But despite all kinds of red flag Netflix/tomorrow studio have pulled it off as best as it could've.

I've never thought One piece could be adapted in live action so uniquely. It's damn f...nk Awesome.

Doesn't Matter if u've watched the anime or read manga Netflix Op live action Still manage to steal your heart. A Big thanks to Oda Sensai (OG mangaka of One piece) the keept eye on every creative decision.

They didn't copy pasted the manga or anime thats the most good thing. They kept the main core of one piece as it is and also added their own creativity. Performances of everybody is damn good.

Cringe Overload,"I don't know where to begin... This was a very poor reflection on the amazing one piece manga and anime which would really hurt casual viewers sentiments towards the one piece property. The soundtrack, the acting, the dialogues, the screenplay are all really lackluster and don't match or even come close to the original animes levels. The only saving grace is the nicely done set designs and certain casting choices especially buggy the clown who gave a great performance. Most other characters especially the straw hats feel very bland and amateurish with the exception of ussop and nami.

Meh!,"Speeking as a fan of the anime, I found this adaptation to be entertaining, pretty unoffensive, however an inferior product compared to the adapted material in every way. While many of these complaints can be excused with time constraints or impraticability or simply budgetary problems, nobody forced the creators of this show to adapt the Manga or anime in the first place. Because of this I really see no reason to excuse it. If the Manga isn't adaptable in a satisfying way, there is no need to adapt it.

As such, the show feels incredibly rushed. The illy defined characters rush from one set to the next, followed by some badly developed twist. What it lacks in coherent and competent story telling it can somewhat make up with charm, but only somewhat. In summation, as a fan of the source material, the experience was pretty meh!

However, while I can only speculate, how I would feel if I had no relationship with the source material, I would probably very much dislike this series as a stand alone product and find it utterly incomprehensible. If I didn't know the source material, I would find the aesthetic to be horribly, rather than a cute homage to the original.

At the end of the day one piece needed no life action. And what it got, while not as terrible as it could have been and overall pretty unoffensive, really adds nothing. Neither to one piece as a whole nor to world of TV. This is rather disappointing, as the team behind the serious seems very passionate, but you can't adapt the unadaptable, otherwise you get at best a cheap knock off.",10-Sep-23,4.0,speeking fan anime found adaptation entertaining pretty unoffensive however inferior product compared adapted material every way many complaints excused time constraints impraticability simply budgetary problems nobody forced creators show adapt manga anime first place really see reason excuse manga isnt adaptable satisfying way need adapt show feels incredibly rushed illy defined characters rush one set next followed badly developed twist lacks coherent competent story telling somewhat make charm somewhat summation fan source material experience pretty meh however speculate would feel relationship source material would probably much dislike series stand alone product find utterly incomprehensible didnt know source material would find aesthetic horribly rather cute homage original end day one piece needed life action got terrible could overall pretty unoffensive really adds nothing neither one piece whole world tv rather disappointing team behind serious seems passionate cant adapt unadaptable otherwise get best cheap knock
Cringe overload,"I've never watched the anime series by the same name, or read the One Piece manga (if it even exists), but was pumped to watch this, and have a nice weekend binge, expecting it to be at least mildly entertaining, based on the high ratings. Well, that didn't happen, unfortunately. I don't even know where to begin with this, but the basis of the extremely problematic foundation this production is the fact that they didn't direct the cast to behave like actual human beings, with natural human mannerisms, body language and speech, but instead made them act and speak like animated characters. The end result is just completely bizarre and creepy and extremely impossible to relate to, as an adult human person. The costumes are another Incredible fail, because instead of creating a wardrobe appropriate for the time period this all is supposed to take place, they copied the costumes of the animated characters. It looks absolutely ridiculous, and many of the clothing choices make no sense. From the pink hair to t-shirts and goofy glasses, it's just laughable how these people failed the assignment. You should have made a serious realistic sci-fi/fantasy series, based on the comics/anime, but adapted to reality and made it as realistic and historically accurate as possible.

Surprisingly decent,"Surprisingly decent, better than how netflix botched cowboy bebop. But for condensed version of first arc they did really well. Some of the casting was questionable but a lot of it was Spot on. They removed some of the fights and did some a little out of order. Then Arlong visits the berat and that was way out of Canon but they pulled it off even if screwing with manga and anime a little.

I'm mixed on this....,"Man.... parts are great other parts are horrible.

Why is lufy so week. Lufy is overly dramatic when he gets hit in action scenes like he can't get up. He's made of rubber. Wouldn't effect him like that.

Nomi was a great pick for her role.

Zoro is okay wish he had a deeper vocie

Usopp didn't care for at all, love him in the anime but he's not funny here and where's to much make up

Sanji is alright, wish he didn't have an ascent....no blood came out of his nose when he saw nami so kinda sad about that

But why does basically everyone have a ascent?

New interesting twist to the one piece story. (Spoiler Alert),Honestly this was done well. And as the cast warms up to their characters more I could see it getting even better. They only finished East Blue. Once they hit the grand line their is much opportunity to progress the story. I love how they teased smoker in the last episode that was cold. Hopefully they could end off in Skypiea in season 2. The main cast was great. Some side characters could be better but for the most part great. It is only season 1.

The first successful adaptation of an anime?,"I heard so much about the anime One Piece but never took the time to watch it.

When I first saw the trailer I gave it a shot and what a great first season it is! The setup of the story, the production, the characters, amazing!

I now understand the hype about this show.

I really like Luffy's optimism, Zoro's loyalty, Nami's hotness and strong will. I hope there will be more seasons ahead. I now will have to watch the Anime seasons to see how it all turns out.

It's more ""American"" then the anime itself but that's only logical I think.

Haven't seen the anime yet this was fun,"I'm not a true fan of manga. I find many of them uninteresting, and over the top, yet it has a distinct style. That being said I did enjoy Attack on titan and Alita battle angel the movie. I've had no expectations when this series popped up at Netflix, I started watching and got immediately hooked.

It was fun! Obviously it was made for kids, yet my kid, who had seen the original manga didn't even start to watch it while I, a grown man, was binge watching the entire season wanting more.

Even for my untrained eye, it was obvious that they've rushed many of the plotlines and characters, as well as your basic explanations of strengths and abilities. But they did it well enough to no bother too much.

Loved the cast. No great acting there, but it works as an ensemble.

Finally a great manga adaptation,"I have been reading One Piece for more than half of my life. So considering that Netflix's track record with manga/anime adaptations is spotty to say the least, I was a bit sceptical. But boy oh joy boy, did they prove me wrong.

On the one hand, this is not the One Piece I know. They significantly changed the plot in almost every arc, even pulled a plot point from way later in the manga into the first season

But on the other hand, this is the One Piece I know. Not a carbon copy, but an adaptation. And they nailed the two important points: Themes and Characters.

For me, the themes of One Piece come down to freedom vs oppression, following your own path instead of the one laid out for you, and inherited will. The changes they made translate these themes perfectly into the new format.

As for the characters, they hit them really well, too. Again, not as carbon copies. Some characters over the top behavior would not translate well to live action and they needed to find other ways to make them distinct enough. But they hit the core of each and every one of them. And then there are those that fit the original so well, it's almost scary (looking at you, Steve Ward).

If I had to be nitpicky, I'd say the rubber fishmen costumes are a bit hit and miss and the show relies a little bit too much on face close-ups from time to time.

But these things are no deal breaker. I finally got to enjoy a story so close to my heart together with my wife, who would never touch a manga or watch an anime. So thank you Netflix. But please don't let the praise go to your head.

"amazing show, can be even better","As an ardent fan of the one piece manga, i was able to appreciate the miriad of details that the producers put in the show, from the paintings in the baratie to smoker and mihawk at the execution scene. You can really tell that the people who made this show truly love one piece, and while i can agree that certain aspects of the story, which was changed quite a lot, can be refined, i am still very satisfied with the end result. I cried, i laughed and enjoyed the entire journey, just like i did when i first read the manga. As oda said, it can be better, but with the baroque works saga coming up i trust in the producers to deliver even better content and improve on aspects that were slightly overlooked in this first season.",31-Aug-23,9.0,ardent fan one piece manga able appreciate miriad details producers put show paintings baratie smoker mihawk execution scene really tell people made show truly love one piece agree certain aspects story changed quite lot refined still satisfied end result cried laughed enjoyed entire journey like first read manga oda said better baroque works saga coming trust producers deliver even better content improve aspects slightly overlooked first season
"Way better than it had a right to be, especially from Netflix","This was way better than it had a right to be. A few annoyances here and there with characters, but OVERALL... I think it was a successful first season.

The two biggest issues with this adaptation was casting of Luffy and Zoro. Half the time Luffy's native Mexican Accent was too thick and he also was kind of a bad actor. He was doing his best which you can clearly tell, but sometimes lines just didn't hit like they should or intended to. I think the writing and characterization was there, but the delivery wasn't. He was too flat. Also even though he's younger than me, he looks older in some scenes, it's weird. In some scenes it looks like a 40+ year old man playing a 19 year old instead of a 33yo man.

Zoro, was just a lot of wrong, and it wasn't the actor's fault, this time we could blame the writing and characterization. Choice wise, I think they picked the right person. But they made him too dead pan, where in the animation he was stoic not dead and one dimensional. I don't know why they wrote him as a monotone and bland character.

Everyone else I thought was casted well. Even race swap Usopp. I think was great. I mean Buggy couldn't have been casted better, nor that one Warlord, I mean that was perfect acting and casting. Only iffy one was probably Sanji, who given the fact that his name is super Japanese, probably should have been another Japanese person, or gone with an actual frenchman. But he grows on you.

As for the story, I thought it was great, wasn't overly political, respected the tone and heart of the original source material and was a great example of how to shoehorn diversity into a series. By not mentioning it. They started treading dangerously preachy waters with the Fishmen, but that's technically in the source material as well. Which talk about taking a silly concept and some how making it work for live action. I think the Arlong group looked great, that one guy did have cartoonishly large lips, but it wasn't terrible.

Then there's the fight scenes, the fact that a majority of it is done by the actors themselves is insane. It looked great and again, found an impossible balance of realism and cartoon for the fights. I am actively looking forward to season 2. They started out super strong here, and I just (knock on wood) don't see them fumbling anytime soon. It's not perfect, I think Inyaki needs more acting lessons and they need to fix Zoro from being so one dimensional.

How I started watching One piece from 2012,"I started watching one piece anime from 2012. It just came to me. I never had any friend who watch OP. When I was into fb some random guy who has similar likes in my movie watching lists had luffy image in his fb profile pic. I don't want to text him and ask this series name. So I took a snap of one piece title name. When I first saw that, I don't know whats the exact word.

The series title mixed with anchor and luffy figure‚öì‚õµso it's confusing to get the correct name. First I thought the name was ""NEPEC"". And when i searched in Google I learned that the correct name was one piece and started watching one piece through YouTube. Each episodes filled with emotions and tears, joys especially the centralized character luffy who dreams to be a king of all the pirates. Crazy dream right? The decisions he make to accomplish his dream remains me of my personal dream.

So, that's the story of me, and how I started watching OP. I have seen many live action adaptions from anime which resulted in failure. But from the first I had full hopes after seen the trailer and the production crew who going to work on this project. Now I have seen all the 8 episodes and I am damn sure they going to top notch on this one and definitely they going to make more seasons because of the success this is gonna make. Netflix made a bold move and I am very happy that Oda believed to bring back this to live which was also one of my dream which is to bring back one piece into live and myself acting as a luffy, which is kinda weird but still this is my dream, Or atleast giving voice over to this project.

Atleast someone making my dream comes true.

It's name is One Piece and it's gonna be Number One,"The main thing is it's true to it's source. Amazing Screenplay makes you hooked, Actors really put efforts and they never left their character there performance was great, they took time to develop characters, music is awesome, the show overall gave me nostalgia.

"Insane adaptation, loved it!","Like many other One Piece anime and manga fans, felt apprehensive about the live-action adaptation. But dang! Was I in for a surprise! It's nothing short of amazing, leaving me wanting for more, ASAP!

As a devoted One Piece fan, I had my thoughts about the live-action transition. Yet, it completely exceeded my expectations.

What truly sets this adaptation apart is its ability to offer fresh perspectives on our beloved characters. The narrative, and the action sequences are nothing short of breathtaking. The humor, a signature element of One Piece, is spot-on, ensuring that the wit and charm of the series remain intact.

In summary, One Piece live-action is an astonishing tribute to Eiichiro Oda's world that will delight fans and newcomers alike.

Thank you to the creaters who did it right,"I've watched the original anime

And this touched me as well

An adventure to follow

And friends to connect with from home

It's a beautiful and creative world

100 time better than the other junk on Netflix

This has depth and fun

The summed the anime quite view. Condensed but I felt the development and uniqueness of each character was still showed

Can't believe I got emotional during a few scenes.

Anime is rare how it can do that. And it was transfered to this series

I wish for many seasons ahead and a new One Piece live action love.

It lacks behind,"1. It lacks connect.

2. Acting is forced. Except buggy and Dracula mihawk 3. It lacks background scores 4. Luffy is luffy because of his hardwork guts and qurkyness. Show made luffy character as serious as Zoros in manga.

5. Show felt rushed. Emotion of zoro to his master when his friend dies and when he ask sword is very iconic . They just rushed that away. Same when Sanji was leaving Baratia√© in anime he was crying the hell from inside. And he looses his control when One leg head cheif said take care. He breaks his cool and kneel down towards him. Again when usaap story starts he is missing his 3 friends. And his notories behaviour should have been well known. But when captain curo said no body ll believe him. Man he didn't put an effort on being a liar. Villagers suppose to be irritated by his fake pirate call but also get it as a habbit like a daily habbit which they feel missing when he stopped doing that . Nami sisters doesnot look anything like name at all. They suppose to look alike. And Sanji lack the rizz and charam and quarky sound infront of women. Nami suppose to be funny and cunning like jack sparrow. She want it she get it.. she never keave the treasure behind. But in show she is giving back treasure. No ways thats nami.

And Arlong powers were so deemed. He never ever bited. He was suppose to be shark man like in sucide squide. But the final battle is so wrong. Luffy said he ll destroy the place. Lol luffy never plans. It happens as he act. He never cared about the consequences of planning.",01-Sep-23,6.0,lacks connect acting forced except buggy dracula mihawk lacks background scores luffy luffy hardwork guts qurkyness show made luffy character serious zoros manga show felt rushed emotion zoro master friend dies ask sword iconic rushed away sanji leaving baratia anime crying hell inside looses control one leg head cheif said take care breaks cool kneel towards usaap story starts missing friends notories behaviour well known captain curo said body believe man didnt put effort liar villagers suppose irritated fake pirate call also get habbit like daily habbit feel missing stopped nami sisters doesnot look anything like name suppose look alike sanji lack rizz charam quarky sound infront women nami suppose funny cunning like jack sparrow want get never keave treasure behind show giving back treasure ways thats nami arlong powers deemed never ever bited suppose shark man like sucide squide final battle wrong luffy said destroy place lol luffy never plans happens act never cared consequences planning
This. Is. Amazing.,"Watched the anime as a kid and haven't given it a single thought for at least 15 years. Suddenly I see the trailer on Netflix and immediately thought ""man, this is gonna suck, I have to watch this lol"".

And it blew my expectations out of the roof. The cast is perfect, looking sooo fine. The pacing is great, the writing's good. You can tell the creators really wanted to honor this piece of fiction and paid so much attention to the details. Already on my third rewatch and a couple of episodes in to the anime as well.

I wanted to hate it, I tried to find small things that would annoy me. Zoro's too serious, Usopp is too likeable, where is Sanji's curly eyebrows?? But it alls works so well.

I think this show will be one of Netflix pillar series the coming years.

Here's hoping for a season two *fingers crossed*.",07-Sep-23,10.0,watched anime kid havent given single thought least years suddenly see trailer netflix immediately thought man gonna suck watch lol blew expectations roof cast perfect looking sooo fine pacing great writings good tell creators really wanted honor piece fiction paid much attention details already third rewatch couple episodes anime well wanted hate tried find small things would annoy zoros serious usopp likeable sanjis curly eyebrows alls works well think show one netflix pillar series coming years heres hoping season two fingers crossed
As a Manga/Anime Fan....,"The show is good. Definitely a great adaption, but I still don't think its worthy of a 8+ rating.

And only say this because a fan of the original material i just feel like it couldn't quite capture the true feeling of ONE PIECE. There were small moments of it, I particularly like the ending with their dreams being said on the barrel, but overall:

-Luffy could have been much much more simplistic. He is sort of a idiot (we love him tho!) and I felt like the actor was just a little too serious sometimes. I wanted him to laugh more, get knocked around in battle, and say ridiculous things more

-Zoro looked great but I do wish his voice was deeper just because the Japanese voice actor has such a recognizable voice

-Nami I thought was also too serious. I wish she charged them interest and gambled more. Hit people on the head; and when she cried for Luffy's help, I wish it was a full on child/ugly cry (snot and all!)

-Sanji deserved twirly eyebrows lol

-But surprisingly the character I thought would be the WORST, was my FAVORITE: Usopp!

(But he barely fought?! I did like he got a kiss tho)

-Arlong was wonderful too! Even if they didn't let him fight to his full potential.

-Buggy was okay but I thought they tried to make him too threatening. To those who don't know: Buggy is also an idiot too. With a wonderfully squeaky voice. Why was his voice not squeaky? :(

But In fact: I loved ALL of the random side characters. I thought they looked AMAZING (Yasopp? Merry?? Zoro'a sensei??? Zeff?? Zeff's blue haired sou-chef guy?!?! Omg) --there were people just walking around in the background that looked EXACTLY like the manga/anime.

THAT was my favorite part!!

The costumes were top notch. I just wish it was a little more light hearted, and little more silly.",25-Sep-23,7.0,show good definitely great adaption still dont think worthy rating say fan original material feel like couldnt quite capture true feeling one piece small moments particularly like ending dreams said barrel overall luffy could much much simplistic sort idiot love tho felt like actor little serious sometimes wanted laugh get knocked around battle say ridiculous things zoro looked great wish voice deeper japanese voice actor recognizable voice nami thought also serious wish charged interest gambled hit people head cried luffys help wish full childugly cry snot sanji deserved twirly eyebrows lol surprisingly character thought would worst favorite usopp barely fought like got kiss tho arlong wonderful even didnt let fight full potential buggy okay thought tried make threatening dont know buggy also idiot wonderfully squeaky voice voice squeaky fact loved random side characters thought looked amazing yasopp merry zoroa sensei zeff zeffs blue haired souchef guy omg people walking around background looked exactly like mangaanime favorite part costumes top notch wish little light hearted little silly
First Time Watching Anything Relating to One Piece.,"Having never read or watched the One Piece anime before, I was still very entertained by this.

There's a good balance of humor, action, and depth which kept me engaged throughout. Even without prior knowledge of One Piece, I could easily follow the plot and connect with the characters. The detail and the layers to the storyline made this interesting and entertaining on its own.

Still, it's adapted from an anime, so there are moments that feel a bit cartoonish, but it's not a big deal overall.

The cast and production were amazing, and the costumes were great. The music and score complemented the scenes nicely.",03-Sep-23,8.0,never read watched one piece anime still entertained theres good balance humor action depth kept engaged throughout even without prior knowledge one piece could easily follow plot connect characters detail layers storyline made interesting entertaining still adapted anime moments feel bit cartoonish big deal overall cast production amazing costumes great music score complemented scenes nicely
Having fun,"All hardcore fans such as myself knows that this IP is nearly impossible to adapt into Live action. Guys remember this is east blue. Things really get complicated from now on and I'm afraid that there will be no budget in the world that could afford a marineford arc so we need to stop complaining how things are not adapted 1 to 1.

One Piece is much more than fancy visuals, its about laughs and tears. Hopes and dreams and trying to be your best self everyday and fight to reach your goals.

Great anime adaption,"Was a rare example of a succesful translation of one media to another. This stayed true and honored the anime while making it its own and the graphics, actors, and tone was great. The cgi looked realistic despite its cartoonish origins.

I loved the first season and it's introduction of all the characters and the world of one piece. I hope it gets renewed as it truly was one of the few true bright spots I've seen in a Netflix original in a while, a truly unique show that is exceptionally well done.

I know the series it comes from is very long so idk how far they will truly ever get into it but I hope they truly do explore and expand on the show.",08-Sep-23,10.0,rare example succesful translation one media another stayed true honored anime making graphics actors tone great cgi looked realistic despite cartoonish origins loved first season introduction characters world one piece hope gets renewed truly one true bright spots ive seen netflix original truly unique show exceptionally well done know series comes long idk far truly ever get hope truly explore expand show
Masterpiece + creativity,"I am following the original story and am familiar with the events, and I was afraid that I would get bored while watching, but the series exceeded my expectations.

I feel like I'm at peace. For the first time, I experience that feeling, guys. When you love a series or movie and wish you could forget it in order to watch it again.

Messed up a bit but better than any other live action out there,"Broo w*f is this... the series is totally fked up they've shown zoro acting in so much attitude+ he's not even laughing like he used to before his fight against mihawk

The biggest flaw in the live action is that they've shown Zoro killed Mr.7 in Shells Town itself however in the anime during the Alabasta Arc, the one's who are given the responsibility of firing the canon are Mr 7 and his partner so how did they kill him in Shell's town..

Well this flaw was big as it was but the series has also messed up the whole order of the anime and I can't help but compare the anime coz if I don't the live action seems like a whole other anime itself but other than that the cast performed really well and the vfx was amazing too.",31-Aug-23,4.0,broo wf series totally fked theyve shown zoro acting much attitude hes even laughing like used fight mihawk biggest flaw live action theyve shown zoro killed mr shells town however anime alabasta arc ones given responsibility firing canon mr partner kill shells town well flaw big series also messed whole order anime cant help compare anime coz dont live action seems like whole anime cast performed really well vfx amazing
Best anime live action definitely must watch for everyone,"I will tell you what I experienced during the whole live action, when I was watching in the initial 2 episodes I thought that this is also be trash like the other live action adaptation but that is because the time length here compare to the time length in the anime or manga is short (this you will understand when you watch the whole web series) so the direction is such they twist the story a little bit means the way it was told in manga and web series a little different because of which the impact which that put was lost, which is really important to define the character of the straw hats but later on the other episodes when i watched i realized ok they cut that scenes no problem but they develop the characters of the straw hats in the different way and also the characters are the way it meant to be they are like the same old straw hats but I think luffy got some brains now.

So my experience is like woooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

What is that?,"The manga series which then became an anime TV show has now been adapted into A such nonsense by Netflix!

It can't be compared to any good movie as this is a total fail in every piece: casting, acting, characters, costumes, fights, story etc.

All characters goggle and mug like they're in a B-class comedy.

Producers put a kit of effort into the action sequences but they look like a parody from Asia such as Shaolin Soccer or Kung Fu Hustle but a few levels below.

But... how annoying these fish-eye lenses and unceasing handheld low-angle close-ups!

A great anime adaption!,"First I want to say, this show is significantly better than I expected. The story has good pacing (of course there are things shown early but do you expect a 500 episode netflix series? Personally should it show some things quicker as the anime is so long people are immediately turned off by the length of it)

The characters and the world feel great, Buggy the clowns performance was fantastic. The casting of the crew I think again was great. I had initially disliked the performance of Luffy in the trailer. However, after watching the show my opinions have changed for the better. I am excited for the future of this show, and the future of anime adaptations.

Disappointment in the way of story telling and changes in the live action,"First of all I'm the biggest fan of one piece story telling,foreshadowing and the elevation that given to the characters.

But the live action has did a decent job in executing the high level of VFX that I was looking forward too But the way they changed the story for there convenience is disappointment Arlong park arc should be the stage setter to whole one piece story but they made a joke out of it And the baratie episode should be elevating the straw hat capabilities and encourage sanji to join the crew And here is where we learn what luffy's ideology is and for what length's he will go for his friends and his dream.

They just scratch the surface of the story and revealing grap at very first may not be likeable for many one piece fans as I didn't like that much so please see through the upcoming coming story which would be more accurate with the manga and anime that's it.",01-Sep-23,7.0,first im biggest fan one piece story tellingforeshadowing elevation given characters live action decent job executing high level vfx looking forward way changed story convenience disappointment arlong park arc stage setter whole one piece story made joke baratie episode elevating straw hat capabilities encourage sanji join crew learn luffys ideology lengths go friends dream scratch surface story revealing grap first may likeable many one piece fans didnt like much please see upcoming coming story would accurate manga anime thats
I got a huge craving to watch the anime (again)after this amazing show,"I was blown away by this adaptation, I started watching as soon as it was released on Netflix. I'll explain why I did it: I do like some animes, although I haven't been watching them much lately. Back then when I was 20 y old, geez, It's been seven years down the road by now, I did watched a few episodes of One piece, and to tell the truth, it didn't catch my fancy that much back then, though the anime is well written, the characters are compelling, the goofy stylish is kinda funny, some characters are depth to the point you get totally engaged with them. As I knew the anime from long time,I decided to give it a chance , even knowing that every live action anime that I've briefly seen has been nothing short of a disaster, I delve in it and what a great surprise I had watching this! It's freaking awesome, boy, do I loved binge watching the show, loved the characters, scenario, the set designs, action sequences, not to mention the actors, ( I've got a crush on Emily Ruddy lol). The portrayal of Luffy was perfect, always joyful like in the anime. The chemistry between the characters don't feel forced, it's natural ., So much that add some complexity and depth to them.

Ok but flawed,"I saw people praising this thing to the skies on Youtube, so decided to check it out. I find it ok, but overrated. First of all , I often loathe the look of it. Many scenes are slathered with the idiotic teal and orange color scheme that Hollywood is infatuated with. It's UGLY. I especially hated the dim, drab color scheme of Kaya's house. What a depressing look, and it's not justified by claiming it's ""intentional"".

Second, I find the ethics of the entire premise very muddled. Pirates are people who steal. They loot. They kill innocents. So why the hell should I admire anyone who wants to be one?? Now Luffy (so far) doesn't do the things I mentioned. He hasn't stolen, he hasn't robbed or killed innocents. In fact, he has defended them against bad guys. In effect, he's a ""non-pirate pirate"". It all adds up to a contradiction.

Third, I can't STAND Usopp. He's little more than a pathetic attempt at comic relief, what with his simpering look and demeanor. He's barely competent as a sailor, and all but useless as a fighter. He's almost always doing little more than cowering or running away when the fighting begins. Koby doesn't interest me much either. He wants to arrest Luffy, but doesn't want to?? He comes across as far too weak to actually do anything.

Fourth, apparently, any genuine romantic interest is verboten in modern Hollywood. The most you ever see is men and women being ""friends"". Meh.

There are positives. Nami, Zoro, and Sanji have interesting back stories. In Zoro's backstory, It was SHOCKING to see a female character defy the modern left wing Hollywood zeitgeist by openly saying that an adult female can't defeat an adult male in combat, due to biological reality. What?? An acknowledgement of reality??

Nami's back story is the most tragic and heartfelt. It was moving to finally see what motivated her.

Finally, there is Luffy. He goes on and on about being a ""pirate"", but as I said, he doesn't act like one. He's helpful and kind. His endless optimism and loyalty to his friends is quite endearing. It's these characters who give the show what value it has.",27-Sep-23,6.0,saw people praising thing skies youtube decided check find ok overrated first often loathe look many scenes slathered idiotic teal orange color scheme hollywood infatuated ugly especially hated dim drab color scheme kayas house depressing look justified claiming intentional second find ethics entire premise muddled pirates people steal loot kill innocents hell admire anyone wants one luffy far doesnt things mentioned hasnt stolen hasnt robbed killed innocents fact defended bad guys effect hes nonpirate pirate adds contradiction third cant stand usopp hes little pathetic attempt comic relief simpering look demeanor hes barely competent sailor useless fighter hes almost always little cowering running away fighting begins koby doesnt interest much either wants arrest luffy doesnt want comes across far weak actually anything fourth apparently genuine romantic interest verboten modern hollywood ever see men women friends meh positives nami zoro sanji interesting back stories zoros backstory shocking see female character defy modern left wing hollywood zeitgeist openly saying adult female cant defeat adult male combat due biological reality acknowledgement reality namis back story tragic heartfelt moving finally see motivated finally luffy goes pirate said doesnt act like one hes helpful kind endless optimism loyalty friends quite endearing characters give show value
Very poor,"The 2023 live-action adaptation of One Piece is a disappointment on all fronts. The acting is wooden, the story is rushed, and the special effects are subpar. The show fails to capture the magic of the original manga and anime, and it's unlikely to win over any new fans.

One of the biggest problems with the show is the casting. The actors all look the part, but they don't bring any of the characters to life. Luffy is supposed to be a charismatic and enthusiastic leader, but Mackenyu's portrayal is flat and boring. Zoro is supposed to be a stoic and deadly swordsman, but Morgan Davies' performance is stiff and unconvincing.

The story is also a mess. The show tries to cram too much into too few episodes, and as a result, the pacing is rushed and chaotic. Important plot points are glossed over, and character development is sacrificed in the name of moving the story forward.

The special effects are also a letdown. The show's budget is clearly limited, and it shows in the cheap-looking CGI. The fight scenes are particularly underwhelming, and they lack the excitement and spectacle of the anime.

Overall, the 2023 live-action adaptation of One Piece is a failure. It's a boring, poorly-acted, and visually unappealing show that does a disservice to the original material. If you're a fan of One Piece, I recommend skipping this one.",02-Sep-23,3.0,liveaction adaptation one piece disappointment fronts acting wooden story rushed special effects subpar show fails capture magic original manga anime unlikely win new fans one biggest problems show casting actors look part dont bring characters life luffy supposed charismatic enthusiastic leader mackenyus portrayal flat boring zoro supposed stoic deadly swordsman morgan davies performance stiff unconvincing story also mess show tries cram much episodes result pacing rushed chaotic important plot points glossed character development sacrificed name moving story forward special effects also letdown shows budget clearly limited shows cheaplooking cgi fight scenes particularly underwhelming lack excitement spectacle anime overall liveaction adaptation one piece failure boring poorlyacted visually unappealing show disservice original material youre fan one piece recommend skipping one

I didn't know any of the background so enjoyed it for what it is and am really looking forward to the next series.

Its not what you would traditionally think of as Anime but its also not Pirates of the Caribbean. Its very much its own thing and does it incredibly well.

Exceeded all my expectations,"Been an OP fan for 15 years. I had low expectations for the live action series given the complexity and expansiveness of the one piece world, and the undoubtedly challenging visual effects that would be needed to replicate the manga/anime scenes.

I'm pleased to say that the OP team have done a phenomenal job of bringing to life one piece, whilst still staying fairly true to the source material. Aesthetically the OP world they have created is awesome, and the visual effects and sound track are excellent. The cast on the whole are great and was particularly impressed by Garp, Nami and Zoro who really match their anime counterparts. There are unfortunately a few bizarre casting choices (Gol. D Roger, Ben Beckman - the former lacking gravitas, and the latter not remotely resembling the towering figure portrayed in the anime).

Nonetheless OP live action - really delivers. There are some really stunning visual effects like the sea monster at windmill village and Luffy's Gomu Gomu no moves. Subtle plot and behavioural changes are necessary and welcome, giving greater importance to the Garp - Luffy relationship, and toning down some of Sanji's creepiness!

Really, really hope they get commissioned for another 7 seasons (at least)!",04-Sep-23,10.0,op fan years low expectations live action series given complexity expansiveness one piece world undoubtedly challenging visual effects would needed replicate mangaanime scenes im pleased say op team done phenomenal job bringing life one piece whilst still staying fairly true source material aesthetically op world created awesome visual effects sound track excellent cast whole great particularly impressed garp nami zoro really match anime counterparts unfortunately bizarre casting choices gol roger ben beckman former lacking gravitas latter remotely resembling towering figure portrayed anime nonetheless op live action really delivers really stunning visual effects like sea monster windmill village luffys gomu gomu moves subtle plot behavioural changes necessary welcome giving greater importance garp luffy relationship toning sanjis creepiness really really hope get commissioned another seasons least
Not as expected,"It was fun to watch but trying to copy some things from anime it's just not possible and make it look weird sometimes. Cgis sometimes were great (with buggy for example) but most of them were so fake. Scenes that brought tears in my eyes in anime, I watched them without feeling anything here. Watch Nami - Luffy - hat scene in anime and la series and feel the huge difference. They have to do also better work with costumes and coloured hair because sometimes you feel like they are some guys in a carnival party. Overall I liked what they tried to do but it needs people who love one piece and can put their passion on these series to make it better. Zoro's actor is an example and you can see his acting is much better than some other characters

I hope next season they will focus to make it feel more realistic and to try adapt the manga and not the anime.

Fresh and exciting,"I haven't watched the anime series before, and after wathed this live action version, I decided to start watch the anime. It has some differences between both but I am enjoying watch this live action. The storyline is similar but not as detailed as the anime version. I did not regret watch this version of One Piece.

Some people don't like the character of Roronoa Zoro in this live action version, but I am in love with his character here. The actor of Luffy was great as well, but I am not really the big fan of Nami.

I look forward to the road ahead for this take on a cult classic anime, Excited to hopefully see the rest of the straw hat crew some day.

Don't try to compare it to the anime version,"I just finished watching the whole season and I gotta say it's fairly good. Hear me out.

We all know that oda's one piece is a true masterpiece because he has a great sense of imagination and story telling. This story in some cases is so wild that it can't be truly brought into live action and yet the casts and producers tried their best. Yes, the story is a little bit different and some scenes doesn't convey the feeling you get from anime BUT I don't believe it could be made better than this. Because in anime and manga there's no limit, you can draw anything while in live action there many limitations.

When you try to compare it with the anime you won't enjoy it as much. Just take it for what it is, live action with lots of effort and a huge budget.",01-Sep-23,9.0,finished watching whole season gotta say fairly good hear know odas one piece true masterpiece great sense imagination story telling story cases wild cant truly brought live action yet casts producers tried best yes story little bit different scenes doesnt convey feeling get anime dont believe could made better anime manga theres limit draw anything live action many limitations try compare anime wont enjoy much take live action lots effort huge budget

Fantastic introduction into Live action one piece,"Blown away by the sets.

The pace of the episodes is great .

The actors all managed to keep true to their characters, with also bringing something new.

Personal favourite has to be zoro , we already knew the actor is a big fan of One piece , and you can tell how he captures zoros dead pan humour.

Buggy the clown is also fantastic, really developed the character beyond what we knew already.

Its corny at times , but that's one piece, I'm sure it will draw in new audiences both young and old , and we can enjoy many more adventures with the live action straw hats.

Really hope they get a 2nd series...The grand line awaits.",02-Sep-23,9.0,blown away sets pace episodes great actors managed keep true characters also bringing something new personal favourite zoro already knew actor big fan one piece tell captures zoros dead pan humour buggy clown also fantastic really developed character beyond knew already corny times thats one piece im sure draw new audiences young old enjoy many adventures live action straw hats really hope get nd seriesthe grand line awaits
Didn't sit well with me,This show is okay not bad but it's a great disappointment for somebody who watched this anime for more then a decade now and got introduced to it on the tv long back in early 2000s. It doesn't carry they vibe the characters are not the same characters that watched for many year. The moment I saw Gol d. Roger he was not the same Gol D. Roger the actor the scene and dialogue didn't carry that impact. The man who played Gol d. Roger didn't had the passion in his speech like he ment it to start something big.

The best Live action of the Century üíØ,"The new live-action version of One Piece, a decades-running Japanese comics series that has been adapted into a beloved anime series and many animated features, could actually play well for those two audience segments. Hardcore fans of previous incarnations may simply be fascinated to see such eccentric material finally and improbably translated into flesh and blood, while Netflix surfers intrigued by a strange, pirate-centric, superpower-augmented adventure-fantasy series may delight in the sheer novelty factor. It's everyone else in the casual in-between that could wind up staring at the screen with a puzzled expression. In its broad outlines, One Piece contains multiple elements seen in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. It's about a band of likable outlaws searching for the titular single-serving treasure that will confer the title King of the Pirates upon whoever finds it, while they're pursued by rival pirates and officious yet vaguely corrupt marines. But Monkey D Luffy (I√±aki Godoy) is arguably closer to signing up with the VeggieTales than he is to becoming Jack Sparrow; he's a cheerful, wide-eyed, stretchy-limbed young dreamer who wants to become a pirate captain and king without actually stealing anything or terrorizing anyone. He's soon joined, with some reluctance, by pirate-hunting swordsman Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu) and wily thief Nami (Emily Rudd), whose backstories are filled in as the eight-episode season proceeds.",15-Sep-23,10.0,new liveaction version one piece decadesrunning japanese comics series adapted beloved anime series many animated features could actually play well two audience segments hardcore fans previous incarnations may simply fascinated see eccentric material finally improbably translated flesh blood netflix surfers intrigued strange piratecentric superpoweraugmented adventurefantasy series may delight sheer novelty factor everyone else casual inbetween could wind staring screen puzzled expression broad outlines one piece contains multiple elements seen pirates caribbean movies band likable outlaws searching titular singleserving treasure confer title king pirates upon whoever finds theyre pursued rival pirates officious yet vaguely corrupt marines monkey luffy iaki godoy arguably closer signing veggietales becoming jack sparrow hes cheerful wideeyed stretchylimbed young dreamer wants become pirate captain king without actually stealing anything terrorizing anyone hes soon joined reluctance piratehunting swordsman roronoa zoro mackenyu wily thief nami emily rudd whose backstories filled eightepisode season proceeds
Netflix live anime normally suck.. BUT,Thie definitely does not suck! I have never watched one piece it has always been something I have wanted to watch but refuse to sink into 1000+ episodes I think it's too far gone for me! If I started watching in the early 2000s like I did dragonball then I guess 1000 episodes is not too bad! Anyways this show is very addictive I am 3 episodes in and loving it. When I first saw the trailer I rolled my eyes and thought here we go another anime netflix are going to destroy but it is actually very good. I hope netflix sticks with this one and continues making seasons rather than calling it a day after 1 season like they normally do!,05-Sep-23,10.0,thie definitely suck never watched one piece always something wanted watch refuse sink episodes think far gone started watching early like dragonball guess episodes bad anyways show addictive episodes loving first saw trailer rolled eyes thought go another anime netflix going destroy actually good hope netflix sticks one continues making seasons rather calling day season like normally

Such an incredible experience, it was nothing short of being THE CURSE BREAKER. I was hooked, I was attached to the characters, and this goes without saying, but the SETS WERE BEAUTIFUL, perfectly capturing the fantastical world that is One Piece. I won't deny I had my fair share of worries before it released, especially with cgi, but that was soon put to rest. I really really hope they release season 2, and soon, because this show really was everything I needed it to be. I am a major fan of the anime and manga, but even if I went in not knowing anything, being a completely new viewer, like my sister did, it would still be a genuinely amazing show. So good infact my sister has started to watch the anime herself. The cast did amazing portraying their characters, I was attached and still am.

Easily one of the best live action adaptations of an anime/manga,"There's been quite a few attempts at live-action adaptations of anime and unfortunately many have fallen far short of being good. The prospect of a live-action One Piece should be by all accounts a guaranteed disaster, a product that shows new lows...and yet in a strange twist of fate, this might be the most successful adaptation yet.

From the fantastic set design, the ability to properly adapt character designs, the quality of the action choreography, and most importantly the chemistry, likability, and the nearly perfectly portrayed Straw Hat crew this show gets so many things right.

The CGI isnt that bad, get over it. There's a lot of good here. People have to realize that the creators of this show put their heart and soul into making this for us.

Ad adaptation that made me really happy,"Everybody involved in this made an *excellent* job and created an adaptation that's vibrant, hilarious, exciting, and that brought back full force all the feelings from reading those first volumes of the manga for the first time more than twenty years ago. The cast is absolutely perfect and gives such an earnest interpretation, from the Straw Hat Crew to all the villains (a special shout out to Buggy, his mix of creepy and silly was spot on) to even the smaller side character. I thought the secondary storyline about Garp, Koby, and Helmeppo was a good addiction and created balance. But it's the building relationship between the Straw Hats that's really the shining light in this adaptation, as it should be! Almost all the changes in the plot made sense with the time constraint, really my only complaint is this could have easily had at least one episode more.

The set and costumes are another highlight, I loved how nobody was afrid to embrace the over the top, occasionally absurd aesthetic that makes One Piece so unique and impactful. It was great!

And I also appreciated how they worked very hard not to have a rushed ending, but instead took their time with an epilogue that was emotional and just pumped up the excitement for the season 2 i so very hope we get up through the roof!

"Great story, smooth flow, interesting characters!","Usually, I am into thrillers, crime, mystery, and maybe some action and horror. But there is another genre that fascinates me if done correctly.

Fantasy/Adventure movies!

One Piece is a very well-made series that is about a young, aspiring pirate captain who sets out to find the mythical treasure called the 'One Piece' and thereby attain the title of the 'Pirate King'.

On his journey, he meets and befriends a bunch of loyal crew with certain skills and makes far more enemies with even stronger skills. I am presently into the 6th episode after binge-watching 5 back-to-back episodes last night, so I still don't know the ending.

But this is one well-crafted movie with excellent sets, a good solid storyline with interesting and diversified characters, the right dose of humor, impressive acting and casting, and an ample dose of FANTASY!

At a time when OTTs are loaded with a huge quantity of content, most of them are of poor quality, this comes as a breath of fresh air and I can't wait to finish it this evening.

Set Sail for Adventure: 'One Piece' (2023) Delivers Yet Again,"In a realm where the sea stretches endlessly, where islands hide secrets, and where pirates roam freely, the saga of ""One Piece"" continues to captivate audiences in its newest season, released in 2023. For those who have followed the journey of Monkey D. Luffy and his band of intrepid pirates since the beginning, the allure remains as strong as ever. And for newcomers setting sail for the first time, this is an opportunity to embark on an epic adventure like no other.

The core essence of ""One Piece"" remains intact in this latest season. It's a tale of dreams and determination, of camaraderie forged on the high seas, and of the relentless pursuit of the legendary ""One Piece"" treasure. But what makes this season truly exceptional is its ability to seamlessly blend the familiar with the new, offering a fresh take on the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates.

At the heart of ""One Piece"" has always been the exhilarating blend of adventure. This is a world where the next island over could hold a mystery waiting to be unraveled, where alliances can be formed or broken in the blink of an eye, and where the possibilities are as boundless as the sea itself. In this new season, that spirit of exploration and discovery is alive and well.

The camaraderie among the crew members of the Thousand Sunny is as endearing as ever. The bonds between characters have been a driving force behind the series' enduring popularity. Luffy's unwavering determination, Zoro's unyielding resolve, Nami's sharp wit, Usopp's boundless imagination, Sanji's culinary genius, Chopper's infectious enthusiasm, Robin's enigmatic knowledge, Franky's uncontainable spirit, Brook's musical talents, and Jinbe's unshakable loyalty-all contribute to a crew dynamic that is nothing short of legendary.

But what truly sets ""One Piece"" apart is its central goal: the quest for the mythical treasure known as the ""One Piece."" This treasure is said to grant unimaginable power and wealth to its possessor, and it's the ultimate prize in the world of pirates. It's a dream that fuels the crew's adventures and keeps them sailing forward.

The captivating characters of ""One Piece"" are brought to life with depth and complexity. They grapple with their pasts, strive for their ambitions, and evolve over time. It's this evolution that keeps fans emotionally invested in their journey. As the crew faces new challenges and encounters formidable foes, they continue to grow not just in strength but also as individuals.

The epic sea voyages are a visual feast in this season. The world of ""One Piece"" is vast and diverse, with each island offering a unique culture, history, and set of challenges. From bustling cities to uncharted territories, the animation and artistry bring this world to life with vivid detail. The action sequences are as thrilling as ever, with battles that push the limits of the crew's abilities.

For longtime enthusiasts, this season is a continuation of a beloved odyssey. It's a chance to reunite with old friends and revisit iconic moments. The nostalgia is palpable, and the storytelling remains as engrossing as it was when we first set sail with Luffy and his crew.

For newcomers, this season serves as an inviting entry point into the world of ""One Piece."" While the series has a long history, it's designed in a way that allows new viewers to jump in and enjoy the adventure without feeling overwhelmed by the past. The story arcs are crafted with care, providing context and character development that make it easy to connect with the Straw Hat Pirates.

"Most actors did great, director could done much better","I love most of the actors of choice and I have a feeling they had good chemistry while making the show. However, the way the director made the different scenes was often awkward and made me having mixed feelings about the show as a whole.

The interaction between the straw hat crew members is wonderfully heartwarming, and Garp and the fellow marines does a great job as well. At the other hand several dialogues from the other characters could have been done differently. For example I think Mihawk sounds too snobbish, and the acting from Alvida and Kuro was a bit too exagerrated some places. A bit too many unnecessary elements were put into the scenes that could be done in a more genuine manner instead of overly dramatic.

The way Luffy is animated while delivering punches is a bit underwhelming. The movements should have been a bit quicker so that the action scenes get more intense.",03-Sep-23,6.0,love actors choice feeling good chemistry making show however way director made different scenes often awkward made mixed feelings show whole interaction straw hat crew members wonderfully heartwarming garp fellow marines great job well hand several dialogues characters could done differently example think mihawk sounds snobbish acting alvida kuro bit exagerrated places bit many unnecessary elements put scenes could done genuine manner instead overly dramatic way luffy animated delivering punches bit underwhelming movements bit quicker action scenes get intense
Not worth 10 but what a great adaptation !,"It's not the best part of one piece. Not even close. As a real fan for almost 20 years, I loved the adaptation. But let's be honest, it's not worth 10. 8 would be a greater fit. But not because of the adaptation no. Because it's just not the best part of one piece that's all.

So 10 because the adaptation is well done but 8 because this part of the manga is good but not great.

The 8 episodes cover until episode 45 from the manga. And boy what happen next will be great.

My only fear is if each season covers let's say 50 episodes, knowing that there are today more than 1000+, with the assumption of one season a year, it's gonna be 20 years. And who wants luffy played by a middle aged man ?

They have 2 options. Either more than one a year, but knowing how long today 2 seasons are apart it seems almost impossible, either cutting a lot... which is possible as sometimes the manga is a little bit slow but I fear that some great moments don't make the cut.

So yeah...",10-Sep-23,10.0,best part one piece even close real fan almost years loved adaptation lets honest worth would greater fit adaptation best part one piece thats adaptation well done part manga good great episodes cover episode manga boy happen next great fear season covers lets say episodes knowing today assumption one season year gonna years wants luffy played middle aged man options either one year knowing long today seasons apart seems almost impossible either cutting lot possible sometimes manga little bit slow fear great moments dont make cut yeah
ONE PIECE LIVE ADAPTATION IS A SUCCESS,"I think this will be the curse breaker for live adaptations. Nice flow of the storyline, the changes for the live adaptation makes sense. Expect the unexpected, we all read the manga and watched the anime but the changes on this live adaptation is something to look forward to. To the OP fans, please stop comparing manga, anime and this live adaptation as each of one of them have their own unique style. For me, as long as Oda sensei approves it, its all good. Now for the special effects, they're not bad, actually its quite good. The fighting scenes are dope and really looks cool (Zoro and Sanji). I love how Luffy stretches his body part like in the anime, its not cringey. I'm finished with the English dub and planning to watch it in Japanese dub now, I think the experience and feelings will be more deep dive to the OP experience.",31-Aug-23,10.0,think curse breaker live adaptations nice flow storyline changes live adaptation makes sense expect unexpected read manga watched anime changes live adaptation something look forward op fans please stop comparing manga anime live adaptation one unique style long oda sensei approves good special effects theyre bad actually quite good fighting scenes dope really looks cool zoro sanji love luffy stretches body part like anime cringey im finished english dub planning watch japanese dub think experience feelings deep dive op experience
Just go and watch the anime.,"Just go and watch the anime. You will be better off.

The whole series feels emotionaly empty, big emotional events feel flat. It didnt have the emotional impact it has in the anime.

Lots of things changed (how shanks lost his arm), characters changed or missing (namis sister is black, octopus in arlog crew missing), events missing (baratie fight with kreeg) and important events are cut short (fight with arlong, baratie fight mihawk vs. Zoro).

Luffy isnt Luffy, this char feels diferent.

What i liked is how they recreated settings, costumes and some actor choices.

Better than expected,"The series was very good, Alot of time and money put in to it. I hope there will be a season 2. I cannot wait. The actors did very well. They could have made a little more details in some places and some of the movie is not like the series but very well made. I do recommend this to all. When you start to watch you just want to see more. It is not like any other series out there. Definitely worth looking for. If you wounded if you should give this a shoot. Just do it you will not regret it. Only 8 episodes I which they could have done more but next season maybe if there will be another one.

Unexpected Surprises,"I was laughing and smiling all the way along with my wife, giving each other high 5s on some momentsüòÇ. Oda wasn't wrong, I√±aki Godoy really brings a smile on your face and this was really shocking for me cause I wasn't expecting this reaction from myself.

I saw several reviews before and while watching the show which had an issue with Garp being shown early but he was shown early in cover stories as well so no issues there.

Also sets up Garp-Roger situation-ship nicely.

The build up of Garp and Coby relationship/mentorship is amazing which we didn't get to see in Anime until later on.

But the interaction between Luffy and Garp which wasn't supposed to happen till Water7 is the one some people are really hating on and when I saw a review about this I strongly agreed, was immediately disappointed and thought that this was rushed why would they do this.

But after watching that episode I feel that was a nice touch and rounds up stuff even more so for the Water 7 interaction. Season 2 is far away but I am looking forward to see Alabasta üòÇ already. I just hope they don't take too much liberty and deviate from source like Witcher.

One piece / Eichiro Oda did it again,"Though it's only 8 episodes I really enjoy the series. I just wish they do have more episodes/season so they don't have to skip scenes like missing characters like Jango and Hachi. I like this version of one piece.

And not to mention unshown fight between zoro and mr.7 foreshadowing how he's gonna fight Mr.1 and the number 7 meme after time skip when sanji is the 7th crew to arrive back at sabaody archipelago.

Honestly enjoyed this series from start to finish, the story and characters just draw you in and I couldn't wait to put the next episode on. I really hope Netflix renew this series because I think they're onto a winner here.

I was skeptical but they nailed it.,"When they announced the live action one piece 2 years ago. My first thought was, how? But from the from the first sneak to the first trailer my excitement started to grow, along with an anxiety of ""oh god please don't butcher this"".

Finally the show arrives, and i watch it on day one of course, and ten minutes in i was extremely pleased. Great casting awesome effects, the settings are true to the source and done with great detail, they nailed the characters, and they did an amazing job of capturing the light hearted funness of the one piece anime but also not making it too corny for the live action vibe. I hope this keeps going because the story of one piece is amazing and this opens the door to other live action anime possibilities.",02-Sep-23,10.0,announced live action one piece years ago first thought first sneak first trailer excitement started grow along anxiety oh god please dont butcher finally show arrives watch day one course ten minutes extremely pleased great casting awesome effects settings true source done great detail nailed characters amazing job capturing light hearted funness one piece anime also making corny live action vibe hope keeps going story one piece amazing opens door live action anime possibilities

Excellent. Can't wait for season 2,"This live adaptation of the legendry one piece anime is brilliant. Great story telling. Lots of thanks to the actors, the team and Oda sensei for their amazing work. The show sticks to the original story with some slight tweaks here and there which I loved. I watch the anime and I found it amazing and refreshing to see a slightly different take on the East Blue Saga. What is most fascinating about the show is that it feels a joy to watch. The sad back stories were brilliantly done. If you like this live action show and you have not watched the anime or read the manga, I highly recommend you do. I hope Netflix continues with the show.

They nearly Achieved the Impossible: Turning Fan Expectations into Reality,"Positives:

Spectacular Visuals: The opening moments of the show were a pure spectacle. The visuals of the numerous ships and the vast ocean were truly mesmerizing. It offered a stunning portrayal of the expansive world of ""One Piece.""

Well-Chosen Cast: The casting of the crew and even the extras was commendable. The actors did a great job of bringing the beloved characters to life, capturing their essence and personalities effectively.

Immersive World-Building: The attention to detail in terms of references and world sets was praiseworthy. It was a treat for fans, as it felt like stepping into the vibrant and diverse world created by Eiichiro Oda.

Engaging Soundtrack: The background score, including the use of Aurora's ""My Sails Are Set,"" added depth and emotion to the show. It was a captivating auditory experience, and I found myself getting addicted to it.

Ambitious Achievement: While the show may not have been perfect, it accomplished an incredible feat by successfully translating the complex and expansive ""One Piece"" world into live action. This alone deserves recognition and praise.

Negatives:

Artificial Moments: At times, the show felt a bit artificial, which might pose a challenge for new viewers. It could have benefited from a more seamless introduction to the characters and their journey.

Lack of Grand Line Hype: Unlike the anime, which built up anticipation for the crew's entry into the Grand Line, the live-action adaptation didn't quite capture that sense of excitement. It could have conveyed this pivotal moment with more impact.

Character Portrayals: Certain character portrayals, such as Garp's, left something to be desired. These deviations from the source material might disappoint fans who have strong expectations.

CGI Concerns: While the CGI for Fishermen wasn't a major issue, it could have been improved to enhance the overall viewing experience.

In conclusion, the live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" had its highs and lows. It's likely to be a satisfying watch for fans of the original series, appreciating the effort put into bringing the world to life. However, newcomers might find some aspects less accessible, and there were moments that could have been handled more effectively. Despite its imperfections, it's a commendable attempt to adapt a beloved series into a new format.",04-Sep-23,7.0,positives spectacular visuals opening moments show pure spectacle visuals numerous ships vast ocean truly mesmerizing offered stunning portrayal expansive world one piece wellchosen cast casting crew even extras commendable actors great job bringing beloved characters life capturing essence personalities effectively immersive worldbuilding attention detail terms references world sets praiseworthy treat fans felt like stepping vibrant diverse world created eiichiro oda engaging soundtrack background score including use auroras sails set added depth emotion show captivating auditory experience found getting addicted ambitious achievement show may perfect accomplished incredible feat successfully translating complex expansive one piece world live action alone deserves recognition praise negatives artificial moments times show felt bit artificial might pose challenge new viewers could benefited seamless introduction characters journey lack grand line hype unlike anime built anticipation crews entry grand line liveaction adaptation didnt quite capture sense excitement could conveyed pivotal moment impact character portrayals certain character portrayals garps left something desired deviations source material might disappoint fans strong expectations cgi concerns cgi fishermen wasnt major issue could improved enhance overall viewing experience conclusion liveaction adaptation one piece highs lows likely satisfying watch fans original series appreciating effort put bringing world life however newcomers might find aspects less accessible moments could handled effectively despite imperfections commendable attempt adapt beloved series new format
Fresh Uplifting story that will inspire you,"One Piece, based on popular manga and anime, is about chasing dreams in a different world of vast sea.

Is silly, it is goofy, it is like a cartoon came to life.

I personally wasn't a big fan of the pace in the anime and probably didn't relate to the optimism of Luffy up until I√±aki Godoy brilliantly portrays the character.

Now, I loved every bit of the show.

Almost every moment there is something emotionally profound about the naivety of the main character that it inspires not only other characters but me as the viewer to thrive for freedom and chase dreams :)

The show is full of heart.

"Never gave the anime a try, but thank God I gave this one a try!!","Most anime to live action adaptations simply fail and I knew One Piece as a anime was very popular although I never watched it. So I was like meh, this won't be good.

The reason why I never watched One Piece is because I simply didn't like the way it was drawn with the super exaggerated features of the characters. I did watch other animes like Avatar or Attack on Titan, but I could never really get into One Piece.

So when I heard about the good reviews, I got very curious and I wasn't disappointed at all! The story is so good!! I love all of the characters and the chemistry of the actors is amazing. This really gave people who don't like anime or like me didn't like the style of the anime One Piece a chance to get to know a really good well thought out story with lots of humor, good values and action!

Surprisingly good,"When I started watching this I was already excited since Oda was involved. I think this was one of the best adaptations I ever seen. The cast was picked perfectly, with actors I never heard of that played roles in a amazing way. I honestly don't think that there were a person that could have done so good. The tv show had some changes, but I think they were a good thing, because it was a surprise for who watched the anime. I think they should have kept was the dog scene, I missed that part. And also, I felt like they rushed the Arlong fight, the Kuro fight felt like it was a harder fight.

Flawed but still well-done,"It was not a 100 percent perfect, it had a couple of flaws here and there, the mc felt a bit not fully in tune with his character but he definitely did his best and all the cast members. One thing is that it definitely beat many live actions out there. For example Death Note didn't need any special effects (Ryuk excluded) or any special stunts done but still managed to mess up (lol). I don't get why some actual One piece fans hate it like obviously it won't be a copy and paste of the actual anime, these are real people that can't mimick each and every facial expression and exaggerated thing a 2d character can do. The casts chemistry is also amazing off screen and Oda was said to be involved in its creation which is what encouraged me to watch it and I do not regret.",13-Sep-23,8.0,percent perfect couple flaws mc felt bit fully tune character definitely best cast members one thing definitely beat many live actions example death note didnt need special effects ryuk excluded special stunts done still managed mess lol dont get actual one piece fans hate like obviously wont copy paste actual anime real people cant mimick every facial expression exaggerated thing character casts chemistry also amazing screen oda said involved creation encouraged watch regret

Awestruck,"I am a massive fan of One Piece. So I was anxious about the live adaptations when I first heard the news. I was utterly disappointed with other anime's live adaptations, so I didn't want my favourite anime to go down that road. But this series exceeded my expectations.

I hoped the series would be good but didn't expect it to be this good.

Though there is a slight change in the storyline which is acceptable because anime has 1000+ episodes, the makers did a wonderful job of storytelling. It was hard for me to imagine Luffy's fight action in live. I√±aki Godoy portrayed the role and fight scenes really well. Other actors also did amazing. I bought a Netflix subscription only for this.

Captured a right balance,"I was a fan of the series since 20ish years ago, and when the live action news comes up, i did have a high hope for this. And I am happy to say that this series actually delivers and cross my expectation. This is to me the right balance to tell the story of one piece through live action, it gives us all the important milestone during the east blue saga without trying too much.

Let's talk about the good and the bad. First of all the good :

Casting. Inaki in my opinion really strong pick for luffy and the reason why this series work! He is lovable, he is funny, he is enthusiastic, and he managed to be the glue of all the crew and stories in here. Mackenyu's rule! As zoro really amazing to watch, I can see that many of the audience will stay to watch zoro (and damn mackenyu is so handsome, bet the ladies will love to see him).

Eye candy. All the things I see in the screen is beautiful. From the setting, places, costumes it is well thoughts and pleasing to my eye. I also noticed some symbolism and few easter that are exciting to watch.

Heartfelt moments. As a fan, I know all the major moments that is important to the stories, and this live action delivers it well. It is different from the anime or the manga, but the emotion is there.

Of course let's talk about some of the things that can be improved :

Battle. Many of the battle in the live action is too boring, especially luffy's fight. It didn't managed to give us the sense that luffy is actually a good fighter, he seems weak and a bit uncreative.

Too much of unnecessary story. The live action put some of its weight to tell a story that is not on the manga/anime, and it seems a bit unnecessary. Some minor characters in the manga/anime turns out play a major part in this live action, which in my opinion does not goes well with the story.

Music. Could be better.

All in all, I understand that the live action have its own direction and differs from the anime. I guess the hardcore fan will always hate a deviation in any kind and will have a reason to hate it, it is what it is.

Everything about this is soo nostalgia,Everything from the start of episode 1 to the end of episode 2 it's just soo perfect and each episode was soo full of nostalgia like those characters I have been watching from 8-9 years been brought to real life it just feels soo good. Each and every moment has been adapted soo well and I can't wait for the second season now. I know it will be very difficult from now onwards to adapt some of the characters to make it look real but just like they have done a fine job with Arlong character I hope it will not be that difficult too keep up with designs and make it look just appealing and I know for us one piece fans it would be more then enough. Let's see how they exceed our expectations with second season again!!,02-Sep-23,10.0,everything start episode end episode soo perfect episode soo full nostalgia like characters watching years brought real life feels soo good every moment adapted soo well cant wait second season know difficult onwards adapt characters make look real like done fine job arlong character hope difficult keep designs make look appealing know us one piece fans would enough lets see exceed expectations second season
I can't believe how good this is,"It's still early days, but I can see Netflix really has committed to doing this show justice regardless of how ridiculous the source material can be at times and I say this as someone who loves One Piece. Any criticisms I might have would actually be of the source material. As far as the adaptation goes, it's great, and it gives me great hope for the future of this show.

The cast is doing a fantastic job of representing what can sometimes be very exaggerated characters and I'm in genuine disbelief that someone has been able to adapt this show to such a high degree of success while staying true to the source material and not having the show look too strange to people unfamiliar with One Piece and its quirks.

Hopefully this kicks off a new era of anime and manga adaptations. Let's show this some love.",31-Aug-23,10.0,still early days see netflix really committed show justice regardless ridiculous source material times say someone loves one piece criticisms might would actually source material far adaptation goes great gives great hope future show cast fantastic job representing sometimes exaggerated characters im genuine disbelief someone able adapt show high degree success staying true source material show look strange people unfamiliar one piece quirks hopefully kicks new era anime manga adaptations lets show love
I did not like it,"But as a live action, if there is no comparison, It wasn't too bad,It was really busy. I respect the acting team, but they are not up to the level of the main characters and they couldn't show their characters. I didn't like the change in the story at all. One Piece alone is an unrepeatable masterpiece and it didn't need to be changed at all. Luffy's character is a weak boy. While Luffy's story has been strong since the beginning, Sanji's jokes were very tasteless. If I want to criticize, I can write a thousand pages and only those who have seen the original work will understand. I gave these four marks to the acting team who worked very hard.",01-Sep-23,4.0,live action comparison wasnt badit really busy respect acting team level main characters couldnt show characters didnt like change story one piece alone unrepeatable masterpiece didnt need changed luffys character weak boy luffys story strong since beginning sanjis jokes tasteless want criticize write thousand pages seen original work understand gave four marks acting team worked hard
A worthy live action transposition of a manga,"I'm a reader of One Piece even before it was published as a separate book in my country: I remember reading the first chapters in a manga magazine that featured some new features about six/seven months before the official publication and I liked it even then.

The first teaser didn't inspire me too much confidence, but with the official trailer released later my hype had risen because the themes, dialogues and action scenes seemed oriented towards the right objective.

I saw the series and I was fully satisfied with it: it is not a perfect serie (too much use of the fish eye, special effects not always up to par, but this project could be a precursor to a series of projects, it is normal that the producers do not wanted to risk too much money, even seeing the results with Death Note and Cowboy Bebop), but the interpretation of the characters is excellent.

I had the impression that the actors really loved the manga and I saw this passion in their acting: Godoy represents Luffy very well both in his expressiveness and in his attitudes, sometimes joking, sometimes serious, Mackenyu gives an excellent representation of Zoro, the actor has excellent physical preparation and the action scenes with him are excellent, Rudd also gives life to an excellent Nami, removing those excesses that are appropriate in a manga, but which in a live action would be annoying, I found that Romero was also good in part, even if his Usopp is slightly different (in the manga Usopp has a physical comedy made up of expressions that would be impossible to reproduce in a live action), finally Skylar also gives life to an excellent Sanji, convincing and with an excellent chemistry/rivalry with Zoro.

However, in general the chemistry between the protagonists is fantastic, you can see that they cared a lot about presenting a product that was up to par.

The other actors are also notable: I liked the part given to the Navy, with Garp, Coby and Helmeppo really convincing.

Ultimately an excellent product, I would give it 7 or 8 stars, but I give it 10 simply to counterbalance the too many 1 or 1/2 star bombings: I can understand that someone didn't like it, but giving it so little in my opinion is deliberately damaging it .",13-Sep-23,10.0,im reader one piece even published separate book country remember reading first chapters manga magazine featured new features sixseven months official publication liked even first teaser didnt inspire much confidence official trailer released later hype risen themes dialogues action scenes seemed oriented towards right objective saw series fully satisfied perfect serie much use fish eye special effects always par project could precursor series projects normal producers wanted risk much money even seeing results death note cowboy bebop interpretation characters excellent impression actors really loved manga saw passion acting godoy represents luffy well expressiveness attitudes sometimes joking sometimes serious mackenyu gives excellent representation zoro actor excellent physical preparation action scenes excellent rudd also gives life excellent nami removing excesses appropriate manga live action would annoying found romero also good part even usopp slightly different manga usopp physical comedy made expressions would impossible reproduce live action finally skylar also gives life excellent sanji convincing excellent chemistryrivalry zoro however general chemistry protagonists fantastic see cared lot presenting product par actors also notable liked part given navy garp coby helmeppo really convincing ultimately excellent product would give stars give simply counterbalance many star bombings understand someone didnt like giving little opinion deliberately damaging
Buggy the clown is better in every way!,"So I finished the One Piece Live Action Series last night and I have to say I was very impressed. It was as easily the best anime live action adaptation I have ever seen as a massive one piece fan I was going to be very critical of it but I could only find a few things to nitpick even then the positives out way any negative 10 fold.

The entire show was easily a 8.5-10. I especially liked what they did with buggy, where he was once annoying and unfunny now he is creepy, psychotic and only slightly unfunny he gives real Joker vibes.

But the best thing of all we're the set and character designs, the reimagining of the story and the action. I seriously thought this might be a hate watch but it was incredibly good, seriously a jumping on point for anyone that says one piece is to long to bother watching.",03-Sep-23,9.0,finished one piece live action series last night say impressed easily best anime live action adaptation ever seen massive one piece fan going critical could find things nitpick even positives way negative fold entire show easily especially liked buggy annoying unfunny creepy psychotic slightly unfunny gives real joker vibes best thing set character designs reimagining story action seriously thought might hate watch incredibly good seriously jumping point anyone says one piece long bother watching
"Basically the Movie adaptation of a Big Novel, but in a good way.","I've been a massive fan of the Anime ever sense I was a kid and I think most of us had felt very skeptical about a Netflix Live-Action Adaptation of ONE PIECE, especially sense a large percentage of live-action adaptation based on anime have been pretty terrible. Of course an adaptation will come around to finally break the curse, and it looks like ONE PIECE is the adaptation that broke the curse.

Like I said in the title of this review, this show is basically similar to a movie adaption of a big novel. The main core story and world is the same, however the events and characters have some changes in order for the story to work within the sorter time frame and the restrains of Live-Action compared to the freedom that is in books and animations. And I feel like ONE PIECE really hit a good enough balance with it that most hardcore fan will notice the changes, but find them to be good changes to make the series work in live-action.

Of course like many people say about a Movie adaptation of a Novel. The Anime/Manga is better then the Live-Action. The Manga/Anime has much stronger character development and world building sense it has much more time to really grow those aspects of the story compared to this adaptation. So most fans will still say read the manga or watch the anime over this adaptation.

However, I think most fans like myself will have no issue recommending this adaption, especially toward people that don't want to commit to reading/watching something that would take a entire month, or those that for some reason are just not into anime/cartoon.

So here is hoping that this show is a success for Netflix (so they don't cancel it in less then a month) and hope it bring in more fans to this great series we call ONE PIECE.",31-Aug-23,9.0,ive massive fan anime ever sense kid think us felt skeptical netflix liveaction adaptation one piece especially sense large percentage liveaction adaptation based anime pretty terrible course adaptation come around finally break curse looks like one piece adaptation broke curse like said title review show basically similar movie adaption big novel main core story world however events characters changes order story work within sorter time frame restrains liveaction compared freedom books animations feel like one piece really hit good enough balance hardcore fan notice changes find good changes make series work liveaction course like many people say movie adaptation novel animemanga better liveaction mangaanime much stronger character development world building sense much time really grow aspects story compared adaptation fans still say read manga watch anime adaptation however think fans like issue recommending adaption especially toward people dont want commit readingwatching something would take entire month reason animecartoon hoping show success netflix dont cancel less month hope bring fans great series call one piece

It doesn't follow the same story of the manga but it still clears all other live action series like Fullmetal alchemist, Death note, Dragon ball and Bleach etc...

"The One Piece, IS REAL, We Just, Haven't Found It Yet","So As someone who has never watched One Piece before, I must say, I loved this show, the action, the characters, the CGI, the way the show is shot, they were all AMAZING. All i knew about One Piece, was that Luffy has stretching abilities like Mr. Fantastic, there is a guy with green hair and three swords, and it is a pirate show.

So lets talk about the characters. Luffy was my favorite is was instantly in love with his personality as soon as I saw him, his stretchy powers were wacky and really cool to watch, I√±aki Godoy who plays Luffy was PERFECT, I swear he was born to play that role. His relationship with Shanks and Garp was interesting, one was a father figure and the other was his grandfather, which by the way, when I found out that was his grandfather, i was shook. His relationship with Zoro is probably my favorite out of the group. I like that he has this happy face all the time, but when he gets serious, he really gets SERIOUS, that was shown in the lat episode.

Next is Zoro, the guy with green hair and the three swords, every time he was on screen in an action scene, i loved it, the sword combat in this show is INCREDIBLE, and his duel with Mihawk was very intense, and just like Luffy, i didn't think he would lose, but he did, and lost 2 of his swords in the process. I really like how him and Sanji argue with each other, especially during the final fight with Arlong's fishmen army. His promise to become the worlds greatest swordsmen was a really way to compare him to Luffy, as they both want to for fill their wish.

Next is Nami, is was the most mysterious of them all until the last 2 episodes, there were signs of her talking to someone else in the early episodes, and of course she was apart of Arlong's group, and I like how it affected Luffy more than anyone, but I knew that she would come back on their team as the scene when she asks for help, is probably one of the best scenes in the whole show, the acting in that scene was TOP NOTCH. She really shows off her combat in the first episode when Luffy her and Zoro are fighting Axehand and his group of Marines.

Next is Usopp who is probably my least favorite of the group, not saying he is a bad character cause he isn't, I just thought they could've done more with him, but he did get the only kiss in the show, when he left Kaya to join Luffy and the gang. And i did laugh at the ned when he saw that the back of his head was on the wanted poster. His slingshot skills were interesting tho, and I did love the firebomb attack he did, that was cool.

And last is Sanji, now he was introduced quite late, being introduced in Episode 5, but we still got backstory and why he is the way he is, and the ONLY i cried, is when he left Zeff to join Luffy's crew, idk why that got me, but it did. His combat was quite good, literally using nothing but his legs, and his cooking skills were a good way to show the audience his unique talent to make dishes that nobody else would.

Now the smaller characters like Koby and Helmeppo were good to stay with until the end of the show, with their personalities changing over the course of the show. Arlong was an interesting villain, using the ""our people weren't treated equally"" motive that a lot of villains use, but it was handled well, so I didn't mind it, and i liked his theme song, sounded alot like what Hip-Hop music sounds like these days. The music was incredible and I loved how every title card was different then the rest. Overall this is probably my favorite Netflix show of all time, probably recency bias, but I don't care. I cannot wait for a second season to be announced, cause i know it will happen since this did INCREDIBLY well.

It's the best anime adaptation ever...yet it can be improved.,"I enjoyed Netflix's One Piece and look forward to future seasons. The production quality is high, featuring impressive CGI and excellent crew interactions. It successfully adapts the original anime/manga, even condensing multiple chapters into just 8 episodes.

However, it's not without flaws. The literal translation of some elements from the source material feels awkward. For example, certain costumes look more like cosplay than authentic attire. The show struggles to balance its aesthetic between realism and cartoonishness (leaving it in a weird uncanny valley).

Character design should be more like Buggy and the fishmen (which are spot-on), and less like Alvida and The Black Cat Pirates.

Acting is inconsistent, particularly among the supporting cast, and Luffy's random shouts can be jarring. The unconventional camera angles take some getting used to but are not a deal-breaker.

Overall, it's a promising start to the series.",05-Sep-23,7.0,enjoyed netflixs one piece look forward future seasons production quality high featuring impressive cgi excellent crew interactions successfully adapts original animemanga even condensing multiple chapters episodes however without flaws literal translation elements source material feels awkward example certain costumes look like cosplay authentic attire show struggles balance aesthetic realism cartoonishness leaving weird uncanny valley character design like buggy fishmen spoton less like alvida black cat pirates acting inconsistent particularly among supporting cast luffys random shouts jarring unconventional camera angles take getting used dealbreaker overall promising start series
"Absolutely amazing. It pays attention to getting the spirit of the characters right, and getting a good story.

No Hollywood politics. No un necessary weirdness. Its just fun.

Wish I could erase my One Piece memories for this live action,"I'm a big fan of the One Piece anime. Still following it because it's amazing and it isn't finished yet.

When the news was released about this live action I was worried. When I saw the trailer it felt like my worries were getting confirmed although the production quality seemed good.

I'm now 4 episodes in, and I have some mixed feelings about the show. The good news is that the further I watched it, the more I'm enjoying it. Yet I was surprised by the overly good reception of it, since there were a few things bothering me.

Although it isn't as bad as other live actions I still found the acting lacking and dull at times. But it seems to be improving in later episodes. Some characters move and nod their head too much while talking, which for me is a sign of bad acting skills. Up till now I thought Buggy has been represented best.

Another thing which was bothering me is the quality of costumes. A lot of it looks like cheap versions of what it should be. And everything looks too clean, even the sets. For example I expect a bit of dirt on the clothes or colors to have faded to make it look more realistic / movie like.

All in all it feels like they spend a lot of production value in one area, but saved it in other places. CGI is good, but the action and animation needs to be more snappy and elevated to the level of 2023. I always said Pirates of the Caribbean is what live action One Piece should've been. I actually thought they stole the idea from One Piece.

Noticing all these things I help but wonder how people that don't know anything about One Piece could enjoy this show. But I remember the first time I saw the anime, it wasn't the flashy action I now get to see that got me hooked, but rather the feel of an open world and sense of adventure that kept me craving for more. I'm not able to sense it anymore since I know the story too well, but I hope all the people new to the world of One Piece will.",04-Sep-23,8.0,im big fan one piece anime still following amazing isnt finished yet news released live action worried saw trailer felt like worries getting confirmed although production quality seemed good im episodes mixed feelings show good news watched im enjoying yet surprised overly good reception since things bothering although isnt bad live actions still found acting lacking dull times seems improving later episodes characters move nod head much talking sign bad acting skills till thought buggy represented best another thing bothering quality costumes lot looks like cheap versions everything looks clean even sets example expect bit dirt clothes colors faded make look realistic movie like feels like spend lot production value one area saved places cgi good action animation needs snappy elevated level always said pirates caribbean live action one piece shouldve actually thought stole idea one piece noticing things help wonder people dont know anything one piece could enjoy show remember first time saw anime wasnt flashy action get see got hooked rather feel open world sense adventure kept craving im able sense anymore since know story well hope people new world one piece
"Can say that this is the best live-action adaption I've seen. Not 100%, but decent","As the title says, it's worth watching and overall is pretty good.

8.5-9 out of 10 overall because it stayed true to the original story(mostly...explained down).

Acting - 9/10 Soundtrack - 10/10 (especially Buggy's theme) Scenes - 9/10 (some were simply meh, even for someone that doesn't know the world/plot and too many close-ups that felt odd sometimes) Plot accuracy to the manga/anime - 8/10 (They made many changes, but still kept them in the style of Oda...mostly...some of them...)

There are enough changes made to it that it has some different plots and settings, but it was expected since these are the limitations of a live action(budget, actors, time, physics and so on). That, nonetheless, doesn't explain how they changed a few parts that made it seem worse(for those that know it and for those that don't, even them getting to agree that it was better in the original after I told them the changes). Some I understood because of the said limitations, but honestly, they butchered Nojiko as a character with her first scene. Felt so wrong and bad even for those that didn't know the original story. They said that the scene was ""cringe"" and ""out of place"".

Overall it's a decent show for both OP fans and those that aren't familiar with it. Good casting of the main characters and mostly all secondary ones(with a few exception, but it was to be expected...netflix).

It's worth a watch and I hope for season 2. For the fans that already read/saw the manga/anime they know that it doesn't compare with it/them, but it's good to see a live adaptation that is decent and not totaly trash like almost every other one made over the years.

The Best Live action Ever made,"The characters are casted perfectly,the cgi and special effects are much better than expected and the story although changed from the original source is still an absolute joy to watch.

The actors,and especially Nami,Luffy and Koby are very well done,close enought to the original material but with a flare and twist to their personalities.

As for villains,Buggy is in a league of his own as the actor who plays him did a phenomenal job in bringing the funny yet terrifying clown to life

A disappointing adaptation,"First of all, let's get to the positives: The casting, costumes and the sets are great. Now to the bad parts: It leaves out everything that makes One Piece so special in the first place.

Key character moments are omitted (e.g. Luffy making Koby hit him, etc.). Some characters are missing their key traits. For example, Zoro is missing his humor and Nami is weirdly depressed all the time. There are a lot of changes, but none seem necessary. It is only faithful in a very wide sense, everything that happens is more or less original while only keeping the outlines of the arcs. What doesn't make sense is that if they don't have time to adapt everything, how come they can add so so many new scenes? Most aspects that are cut are heartfelt moments like the dog protecting the store. The show pushes for a new wider narrative to string everything together which doesn't ultimately pay off well.

If you don't know One Piece, it is probably a good show, but it just doesn't even try as an adaptation. It's more like a re-imagining that leaves you disappointed.",31-Aug-23,2.0,first lets get positives casting costumes sets great bad parts leaves everything makes one piece special first place key character moments omitted eg luffy making koby hit etc characters missing key traits example zoro missing humor nami weirdly depressed time lot changes none seem necessary faithful wide sense everything happens less original keeping outlines arcs doesnt make sense dont time adapt everything come add many new scenes aspects cut heartfelt moments like dog protecting store show pushes new wider narrative string everything together doesnt ultimately pay well dont know one piece probably good show doesnt even try adaptation like reimagining leaves disappointed
Never read the Manga or watched the animated...,"Having no background on this IP at all I am actually enjoying the show. I am not a fan of the majority of Japanese animated shows due to the overacting and extreme emoting normally present. Just not something I can get into.

I will say, there is a LOT of sillyness in this show, a LOT of the main character stating his name and that he will be King of the Pirates - I mean like 12 - 13 times an episode it feels like. Episode 1 was a little hard to get through due to the look of a lot of characters as well - but I had to remind myself this is based on an animated series and the creators are really trying to keep things consistent with the original designs.

Ultimately, I decided to embrace the silly. Monkey is, for me, basically Leslie Knope or Ted Lasso, other overly nice, positive, can't get them down personas. If you are like me and new to the world of One Piece I would say either embrace it, or give up watching.

The last issue I can think of is, this is a Netflix show so there is a 99.99999 percent chance it will be cancelled within 2 days of it's premier. If not, it certainly will be season 3 as Netflix has proven, time and again, they do not care about making customer's happy, just about avoiding paying creatives involved any real money that is normally due when a show hits season 4.

It's a Pirate's Life for Me!,"This series was phenomenal! I was a little hesitant, especially bc the Luffy actor they choose was not who I imagined at first. However, he grew on me and I thoUght he was perfect. Come to think about it, the anime Luffy I had to get used to as we, so I guess that's even more confirmation that it fit lol When I tell you I watched this whole season in a day, I mean that I confess to having no life for the amount of hours I watched this lol it was so good I needed to finish it!

What worked:
casting is superb
visually immersive
doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it fun
didn't deviate too much from the original material
they worked with the original creator, Aida, and wouldn't move forward on even a scene without his approval. Very smart!



wholesome! They removed a lot of the perversion from the manga/anime, which I appreciated as now I could promote the show to my kids


What didn't work:
in flashbacks, accents of the child versions don't match the accents of the adult versions, which was weird. Acting was great, but accents were off.

None of those are reasons to not watch the show... go watch the show. I honestly was so touched by the show, I cried a couple of times. Between Luffy and Nami, they delivered such amazing performances, they all did, but those two just emotionally brought it all together. The whole crew is amazingly casted, and I even liked Usopp in this! I didn't care for Usopp in the manga or anime, but I just thought he was hilarious and adorable in this.

Everything I wished for... and more,"I watched the anime and red the manga and for someone who didn't like anime (at first) I feit in love with the world of One Piece.

Then I saw an anouncement. They were gonna do a live action of One Piece... wait? That's impossible to even think about. How?

But I followed this project now for 3 years and something was triggering me that this was not a normal anime project who would fail again. The producers and crew where so dedicated, build all these amazing sets and they had contact with Oda. I quickly believed that this could be something...

And it did.

I am so glad how it turned out. The characters are so well casted. They have so much chemistry with eachother and they give their full 100% for their role. I loved Zoro, Nami, Usopp and Sanji, but Inaki nailed Luffy. Man what a hard character to bring to live. He made it his own and it worked so well.

If we talk about the world... all the sets looked so detailed and amazing. There are changes but the main storyline stays the same. All the epic and emotional scenes are there and they did it justice. I am glad it was not a copy of the anime/manga. Some of the changes where really refreshing.

Wish they could have filmed more then 8 episodes. And I definetely want a season 2.

Amazing,"My original review of the show was confused and upset about the story and pacing as it's much different from the original source material. I watched it originally in English then in Spanish and then in English again (as I'm bilingual). The writers are rather impressive they truly got the vibe of the show and condensed much of the story into a cohesive story. You have to remember this is not a 1 to 1 recreation of the show it's a reimagining of the same world to fit in a condensed format. The show is expertly show and well acted, it may be jarring to those who don't understand the world but once you let your mind go and embrace the weirdness you are gonna have a great ride. Its absolutely nothing like anything you have ever seen on TV and full of mystery and action. It's great watch it and if you want to fully experience the world watch the anime!!!!",31-Aug-23,10.0,original review show confused upset story pacing much different original source material watched originally english spanish english im bilingual writers rather impressive truly got vibe show condensed much story cohesive story remember recreation show reimagining world fit condensed format show expertly show well acted may jarring dont understand world let mind go embrace weirdness gonna great ride absolutely nothing like anything ever seen tv full mystery action great watch want fully experience world watch anime
The show missed the essence of what is actually One Piece,"I tryed. I really tryed. But from the first episode, you understand they totally missed the point. You see, what makes the manga so special is it's philosophy. It's a way of life. From the first episode of this show, you can understand the people who wrote this do not understand One Piece. You just can't make Luffy & Zorro attack at the same time the same opponent. It's an insult to both of them. In One Piece, each character must do it's best to surpass himself and it's only when his about to drown that a nakama comes with an helping hand. Yes, Luffy knows he can't do it alone and he count on his Nakamas. But hell no, he won't ""use"" them if he's not 1000% in need for help. That's just one exemple. The entire show just missed the essence of the strong lessons the manga and the anime actually gives us : how to be the best captain ever, what means true friendship, how to surpass yourself, etc. That's for the writers of this stupid show.

Regarding the actors, some aren't bad, but when the main actor doesn't understand Luffy himself, that is just game over.

And no sandals ? Really ?

Joke apart, maybe as a standalone the show deserve a better rating, like average, regarding what we are fed, on average, these days. But it's One Piece, it's a masterpiece.

WAY better than expected,"The live-action adaptation of One Piece is one of the best live-action adaptations of anime. I actually gave up on Netflix after Cowboy Bebop.

I didn't expect much but all my expectations were completely exceeded. The characters play their roles really well and don't try desperately to imitate their anime counterparts, but rather adapt their style of play perfectly to a live-action adaptation.

The CGI effects and the stunts of the actors in the series are also really impressive.

The series proved that Netflix can continue to make good series if they want to, and anime is no exception.

Heartfelt adventure,"Great story, great characters, grand adventure and heartfelt. This was very entertaining and you just want to spend time with the crew on their adventure. This show is a bit cheesy and awkward at first, but it accepts what it is and that grows as part of the charm, any flaws just end up giving this character. A weird, entertaining and enjoyable show with emotional moments. That is something you don't get with many other shows these days, it's great that this show didn't try to take itself seriously and be realistic, it just wouldn't have worked given the source material. You can really tell the level of respect and love given to the source material in this, it just goes to show, when you adapt something good and stick to the source material you can end up with a great show, something many other directors and show runners should follow, this is a prime example that sets the standard for future adaptations.",04-Sep-23,10.0,great story great characters grand adventure heartfelt entertaining want spend time crew adventure show bit cheesy awkward first accepts grows part charm flaws end giving character weird entertaining enjoyable show emotional moments something dont get many shows days great show didnt try take seriously realistic wouldnt worked given source material really tell level respect love given source material goes show adapt something good stick source material end great show something many directors show runners follow prime example sets standard future adaptations
A good try!,"As someone who has followed the anime I was VERY skeptical when this show popped up. Every live action adaptation I have seen has been bad (except Alita).

The anime One Piece is one of my favorite TV-shows but i don't recommend people to see it because it has over 1000 episodes and is very dragged out. Netflix cuts the corners in a good way an can fit almost 10-15 episodes into one.

Oda the creator could learn a thing from this if he ever decides to do a reboot (kind of like Hunter X hunter did).

I don't understand the anime fans who gives it a 10/10, it's not that good. The anime has given me tears numerous times because the characthers are so much deeper. This adaptation failed to stir any emotions in me.

The more I compare the two the worse the live one gets but if I were to judge it on its own merits I gets a more fair grade.",04-Sep-23,7.0,someone followed anime skeptical show popped every live action adaptation seen bad except alita anime one piece one favorite tvshows dont recommend people see episodes dragged netflix cuts corners good way fit almost episodes one oda creator could learn thing ever decides reboot kind like hunter x hunter dont understand anime fans gives good anime given tears numerous times characthers much deeper adaptation failed stir emotions compare two worse live one gets judge merits gets fair grade
Loved it!,"I have never watched the anime, so this was all new to me.

I had no idea what to expect, when I tried out this show, but I'm completey impressed and it was fun to watch. Loved the characters and the acting! It was so good how they told their story through the flashbacks and slowly brought their skills, quirks to the table.

Great world building, which was very immersive. At some scenes maybe it was too rushed, but 8 episodes are not enough for deeper explanations, still as a newbie I found myself in the middle of a richly detailed world.

I feel like that it was a strong adaptation.

"A Fun Show, Can't Wait for Netflix to Cancel It","One Piece is the latest live action anime production that seems to have figured out the formula for making this a success. Working closely with the original anime artist, the show embraces the silliness of the manga and everyone is overacting to just the right degree to make it entertaining without drawing too much attention to itself. The special effects are fairly impressive while the practical effects really build out the world.

The reason for my title is simply to reflect how frustrated I've become with the Netflix model. Constantly raising rates while producing shows and movies that are well produced but underdeveloped. Stranger Things has been the only big show as of late to survive beyond season two so regardless of how successful this one is, I can't help but think the next season will be its last. Let's hope for continued success.",17-Sep-23,8.0,one piece latest live action anime production seems figured formula making success working closely original anime artist show embraces silliness manga everyone overacting right degree make entertaining without drawing much attention special effects fairly impressive practical effects really build world reason title simply reflect frustrated ive become netflix model constantly raising rates producing shows movies well produced underdeveloped stranger things big show late survive beyond season two regardless successful one cant help think next season last lets hope continued success
It weren't unfounded hopes,"It's already been a couple of years since I saw the first stretch of this anime (which for an attempt that exceeds a thousand episodes, still constitutes a significant amount of story); around like one hundred and something chapters, of a series that I left then interrupted by an excess of personal tasks, of all that one calls life.

That is to say: I'm not a purist of this title, but I keep pristinely in my memory the foundations of its narrative, a quality that usually belongs to exceptional stories.

For some time, I've been searching or waiting for those tales that absorb you, that transport you to a tangible but improbable universe, to these sorts of enchanted realities, to these worlds that tend to inhabit the anime genre so well.

Under the regrettable precedent of Netflix adaptations, I was naturally faced with zero expectations for this release; and, perhaps for the first time, after an endless stream of disappointments, I ended up surprised: it is indeed a good adaptation.

The series is absorbing, immersive, entertaining, the series earns your attention and your desire to know its future. The graduation between fidelity to the original work and molding to the mainstream serialization format (length and pace) is hardly debatable; and although certain aspects of the production level and execution could be criticized (this characteristic sensation of artificiality in netflix productions, of immaculateness; basically of set and props. And the stereotypical approach of performances and writing (which from anime to real life is complicated to calibrate)), in general they made a good work with what they had. The series, ultimately, manages to prevail in its essentials: enchanting with its universe and characters, winning us over with its story.

So even if it's hard to believe it: yes, it's real. After what seemed like an unstoppable torrent of blunders, of degradation of the anime culture, these bozos from Netflix finally made a decent adaptation.

Fatihful adaptation of Oda's beloved story,"From watching this season closely several times I could tell that the Matt Owens and Steven Maeda have respect and love for Oda sensei's manga and they were able to successfully adapt that story to a thrilling and adventurous live action medium.

The actors for this show all performed faithful to their original counterparts which was amazing to see. The actors for our straw hat crew gave it their all in this action packed adventure and they have amazing chemistry with one another. Inaki's portrayal of Luffy is wonderfully whimsical, brave and he is a loveable idiot that makes us feel excited to go on an amazing romantic adventure with him. Mackenyu's portrayal of Zoro is stoic, strong, serious and a dependable right hand man and first mate of the crew. Emily Rudd's portrayal of Nami as a thief with a heart of gold and a tragic past, perfectly captures the original character and carries the Arlong Park 2 part finale to an emotional and impactful conclusion. Taz Skylar's portrayal of Sanji is suave, smooth, confident and it is phenomenal that he learnt kick boxing martial arts and cooking for this role. Jacob Romero's portrayal of Usopp makes the character feel like an underdog who is still finding their confidence and footing in this crazy world. His performance also makes Usopp more cool and he feels more like a dashing rogue.

The best anime to live adaptation to be seen so far,"I'm going to keep it short and simple. No live anime adaption will ever capture the essence of character building, the emotion and story telling as original manga/anime has been written. So that said, this adaption has been fantastic from the cast selection to the chapters shown throughout the 8 (limited, unfortunate as it is) episode series. At the end of the day we want (as fans) to see this re-created epic anime to extend what One Piece really is. Missing out on the heavy backstories that haven't been told to their full extent, (Sanji for on as an example) they have kept the pace of the show at a great level of interest in capturing the essence of anime to as of todays level of cinematography standard, the best it can be. It is definitely worth watching and I can't wait for season 2. Let's see what they can do with Chopper and the grand Line!",04-Sep-23,9.0,im going keep short simple live anime adaption ever capture essence character building emotion story telling original mangaanime written said adaption fantastic cast selection chapters shown throughout limited unfortunate episode series end day want fans see recreated epic anime extend one piece really missing heavy backstories havent told full extent sanji example kept pace show great level interest capturing essence anime todays level cinematography standard best definitely worth watching cant wait season lets see chopper grand line
"Treated with respect, but missed essential details, still fun","As a huge One Piece fan, i watched the live series, to compare it with the anime and re-live some of its magic in a more realistic way. I didnt have high expectations for this one, to be honest. This review might not be useful for someone who hasn't watch the anime.

The plot begins from the beggining of Luffys adventure and takes us until the Arlong saga.

Lets start with the positive aspects. The main cast really hit the mark. Their age, their appearance and the generic behavior is there. The show is treated with respect, the high budget really makes a difference on the technical side and the plot is pretty much loyal to the anime plot. I also liked that it's not dubbed in japanese, it helps to make it more real, as the main cast are not japanese either. A lot of the anime side characters are missing, and thank god for that, 95% of them where accurate cuts. As a matter of fact, they could leave out more side characters too (Kuro sidekicks, were cringe at the least). Main villains (Buggy,Kuro and Arlong) look good. Then fights are a bit shorter but they manage to stay true.

On the negative side, i have to point out a few of the key scenes that lacked the details, that maked them so important, imo.

When kid Luffy is given his straw hat by Shanks in the anime, Luffy cries with flowing tears, while biting his lips, as he tries to act tough in front of his rolemodel that shows him the acceptance he so desperately wanted. In the live series, the kinda missed it, as the kid is simply standing, barely crying.

When Luffy rescues Zoro, he returns him his swords, understanding in a way that Zoro evaluates his swords just in the same way as he does his straw hat. In the live series Zoro takes them himself, lol.

In the anime, when Zoro is facing Mihawk, and denies to backdown, even though he is facing death, Sanji is looking the whole fight, taking a lesson on how to hunt your ambition. In the live series Sanji isn't even there(!), and its sad because its a moment that changes Sanjis character and perception.

As for the starving pirate, who is very proud to eat, and Sanji feeds even though he is a dengerous pirate (showing the essence of acknowlege the true need for help when you see it, and helping others no matter the cost, a huge Sanji trait), in the live series gets turned to a pirate who just asks for food himself!!

In the anime Red Leg sacrifices his leg to save Sanji from drowning, he doesn't eat it out of starving, ffs.

Luffy, in general, here is depicted in a more adventurous and funny way, while in the anime is a bit dumber but truly badass.

I don't think that the live series should be identical to the anime, that can't be and there is not such a need. But, I would suggest watching the series, only as an apetizer for the anime, as most of the unique One Piece essence is still missing. It's still fun to watch, but definetely not top notch stuff.

Surprisingly Decent for a Live Action Manga Adaption,"I came into this show with very low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised. If you told me they were going to make a live action adaption for One Piece a few years ago, and you told me that it was going to be the one adaption that would break the curse of American manga live action adaptions, I wouldn't believe you. One Piece is extremely cartoony, from the characters to the action, and even the plot itself just works better when it's animated. But somehow, Netflix actually did it, and I'm still shocked that it turned out as well as it did.

I didn't completely love this show either. I've read some of the 10/10 reviews on the IMDb site, and while I am genuinely happy for those fans that loved it that much, I didn't think it lived up to anime standards. First of all, I thought it was a little underdeveloped compared to what the anime ended up adapting. This show is trying to adapt the East Blue Saga, one that has eight arcs, 61 episodes, 23 volumes, and 100 manga chapters, into a mere 8 hour-long episodes. My point is, the characters didn't have the time to be properly adapted as I'd hoped them to be. If you've seen the show you know that they they trimmed out a lot of the story in order for it to work in 8 episodes, and while it did work for the most part, it negatively affected the show by making the characters a lot less beloved compared to the anime due to them not getting the screen time I feel like they should've had.

Apart from that, the only other criticism I have for this show is how spotty the CGI can be at times. But I will then turn this negative aspect into a positive review by saying that it didn't look as bad as I thought it would be. I love how the show depended on practical effects for some of the scenes, and when the show did depend on CGI for Luffy and other Devil Fruit users, the action was pretty good. While I did think they cut off on the action in this show, I did enjoy the scenes when they did show Luffy and other Devil Fruit users like Buggy using their powers.

The actors do deserve some praise too, they really helped carried the show. Adapting the personality and energy of these characters into live action can be very difficult compared to how much easier it is for animation when it comes to action and characters showing emotion. Let me say that I am happy that the characters did such a good job recapturing the energy Oda originally created the characters to be like. I thought the main cast did a great job with no miscasts whatsoever. I even liked Koby a lot better in this show than the anime. I always thought Koby was annoying, and every scene that he was in for the anime was a waste of time, and honestly I wouldn't have cared if they didn't have him in the show at all. Though I'm actually glad they kept him because they ended up changing him for the better. For once I actually cared about his stupid dream of becoming a marine. And Koby's appearance in this show actually meant something to the plot of this story.

I can see One Piece fans loving and hating this show, and that's fine. I think this show was a success for the most part and I hope that Season 2 does well, and this time I won't be walking in with low-expectations like I did for this first season. I recommend this show for any hardcore fan of the anime or manga, and even if you haven't been exposed to One Piece, if you're interested in watching this show you do not need to have watched the anime or read the manga to enjoy it. This show is good for old and new fans of the show, as well as general audiences as well.

If the score changes over the years, it's probably because other seasons for this show had come out and changed my stance for this show as a whole. As of now, IMDb doesn't have a feature that allows users to rate or review show's individually by season. So I'm case the score does change, it doesn't apply to the first season. With that being said, I'm giving Season 1 of Netflix's One Piece a 7/10.",04-Sep-23,7.0,came show low expectations pleasantly surprised told going make live action adaption one piece years ago told going one adaption would break curse american manga live action adaptions wouldnt believe one piece extremely cartoony characters action even plot works better animated somehow netflix actually im still shocked turned well didnt completely love show either ive read reviews imdb site genuinely happy fans loved much didnt think lived anime standards first thought little underdeveloped compared anime ended adapting show trying adapt east blue saga one eight arcs episodes volumes manga chapters mere hourlong episodes point characters didnt time properly adapted id hoped youve seen show know trimmed lot story order work episodes work part negatively affected show making characters lot less beloved compared anime due getting screen time feel like shouldve apart criticism show spotty cgi times turn negative aspect positive review saying didnt look bad thought would love show depended practical effects scenes show depend cgi luffy devil fruit users action pretty good think cut action show enjoy scenes show luffy devil fruit users like buggy using powers actors deserve praise really helped carried show adapting personality energy characters live action difficult compared much easier animation comes action characters showing emotion let say happy characters good job recapturing energy oda originally created characters like thought main cast great job miscasts whatsoever even liked koby lot better show anime always thought koby annoying every scene anime waste time honestly wouldnt cared didnt show though im actually glad kept ended changing better actually cared stupid dream becoming marine kobys appearance show actually meant something plot story see one piece fans loving hating show thats fine think show success part hope season well time wont walking lowexpectations like first season recommend show hardcore fan anime manga even havent exposed one piece youre interested watching show need watched anime read manga enjoy show good old new fans show well general audiences well score changes years probably seasons show come changed stance show whole imdb doesnt feature allows users rate review shows individually season im case score change doesnt apply first season said im giving season netflixs one piece
This is NOT One Piece,"A TV show that have no connect to the anime .

It's just like watching cheap version of one piece characters with the worst scenario ever .

Too much changes from the real story . Even zoro principle is not taken seriously . Only on the first episode he gave the enemies his back three times and he raises his middle finger to enemie !!! He is NOT zoro . Luffy haven't seen zoro in the bar and how the hell does nami spawned there? . Garp with roger at the execution or even luffy didn't came out of the barrel in the anime way . They take a anime scene and make it worse I hate to say it but, it doesn't worth my time to watch the cheapest version of One Piece

Pacing is also great though they skipped most of the scenes in the anime. For those who are hating ONE PIECE is made goofy and silly! Also, I add Choreography is also damn good!!

A Sincere and Skilfully Crafted Adaptation of 'One Piece,"Netflix's adaptation of the beloved manga and anime series ""One Piece"" is, overall, a remarkably sincere and well-crafted effort. The show clearly demonstrates a high level of commitment and respect for the source material, which is sure to please long-time fans of the series.

The casting decisions are commendable, with each actor embodying their character's unique traits and quirks convincingly. Whether it's Luffy's optimistic determination, Zoro's stoic discipline, or Nami's cunning wit, the spirit of Eiichiro Oda's vibrant cast of characters shines through in every episode.

The production quality is outstanding, featuring top-notch cinematography, special effects, and costume design that bring the world of ""One Piece"" to life in a way that is both familiar and fresh. The show's musical score is also noteworthy; it perfectly captures the varying moods and atmospheres of the series, enhancing the viewing experience immensely.

However, the series could benefit from more thorough exploration of the characters' backstories. ""One Piece"" is renowned for its rich and emotional character development, and while the Netflix adaptation captures much of this, there's a sense that it could delve even deeper. The source material offers a wealth of background information for each character, and incorporating more of this into the series would add valuable depth and complexity.

In conclusion, Netflix's ""One Piece"" is a high-quality adaptation that does justice to its source material while offering a new perspective. It's a must-watch for fans of the original series, and a great introduction for newcomers. With a little bit more emphasis on character background, it could reach even greater heights.",01-Sep-23,9.0,netflixs adaptation beloved manga anime series one piece overall remarkably sincere wellcrafted effort show clearly demonstrates high level commitment respect source material sure please longtime fans series casting decisions commendable actor embodying characters unique traits quirks convincingly whether luffys optimistic determination zoros stoic discipline namis cunning wit spirit eiichiro odas vibrant cast characters shines every episode production quality outstanding featuring topnotch cinematography special effects costume design bring world one piece life way familiar fresh shows musical score also noteworthy perfectly captures varying moods atmospheres series enhancing viewing experience immensely however series could benefit thorough exploration characters backstories one piece renowned rich emotional character development netflix adaptation captures much theres sense could delve even deeper source material offers wealth background information character incorporating series would add valuable depth complexity conclusion netflixs one piece highquality adaptation justice source material offering new perspective mustwatch fans original series great introduction newcomers little bit emphasis character background could reach even greater heights
Best Netflix series I've watched so far this year,"My kids are huge fans of the original One Piece mange and anime, but I haven't watched it. Watched the first 4 episodes with wife, and even she couldn't quit smiling.

The main character, Luffy, keeps making me think he is the Ted Lasso of the seas with his persistent and infectious optimism. The actor who portrays him is just amazing in this role. All the actors so far have been really good. Yes, many start out feeling a bit cliche or exaggerated, but given a little time, they have already added depth to the characters especially with backstories of the characters.

I will warn that there is a strong fantasy element to the story where some characters have superhero/mutant like abilities. Approach the show as a fantasy adventure with some wonderful comedy, and you will enjoy it much more.

It has been a while since I posted a review on IMDb, but I really had fun watching this tonight, and I think others might enjoy it as well. I really hope Netflix doesn't cancel it. There is a lot of source material to work with, and it feels like they are just scratching the surface. I'm still mad that Netflix cancelled Lockwood & Co., but hopefully this will get renewed.

Kudos to the artists who made this series. Adaptations are tough, and it sounds like you were respectful of the source material while making it accessible to a new audience. It has definitely made me curious to maybe start watching the anime series.

Fan of 23 years and still enjoyed it!,"I must say, the love and dedication given to OPLA was phenomenal. The world building was straight up 10/10. Although I really enjoyed the show, i can't help but noticed some important scenes were deleted or change to the point it doesnt make sense anymore. I know change is a good thing for an adaptation.

What I think is a good change or things i like: 1. Garp and Koby training or chasing luffy.

2. Nami being in Episode 1.

3. Transitioning on flashbacks/backstory.

4. Syrup village arc.

5. Toned down sanji and ussop. I like sanjis personality here.

6. Buggys arc.

7. Bloooooood!

8. Zoros introduction as per mr. 7

Bad: 1. Zoro is way too cool. Too much even. ""If you get in the way of my goal, i will cut your stomach open."" is mising. Also, bent scabbard?!

2. Luffy fighting don kreig. One of the factor that made sanji joined luffy.

3. Ussop fighting to death to save kaya. One of the factors that gained him strawhat crew worthy. He did nothing if you think about it.

4. Luffys fight with arlong is too short. Wayyy to short for a man deemed to be the strongest in east blue (good change of power lvl tho)

Love it bring back great memories,I have been watching the anime for over 17 years. I never rewatched any of the episodes but watching the live action makes me smile. It is way better than what I would have expected. Love seeing all the characters and how they are in real life form. The story line is pretty accurate and the characters are overall true to the anime characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the first season and would recommend to anyone. They did a very good job in my opnion. I cant wait for the next seasons to come!! I just hope they keep going to catch up to where the anime currently is. I would definitely watch all of them.,11-Sep-23,9.0,watching anime years never rewatched episodes watching live action makes smile way better would expected love seeing characters real life form story line pretty accurate characters overall true anime characters thoroughly enjoyed first season would recommend anyone good job opnion cant wait next seasons come hope keep going catch anime currently would definitely watch
THE BEST SHOW I'VE EVER SEEN,"I didn't know anything about this world, but I had such an awesome time that it's been a long time since a series drew me so deeply into its world, I was fascinated by the originality in so many ways that I even wanted to see what it looked like in the original, where I'm not very fond of manga and anime. Beautiful has the atmosphere of this series. A big job was done by the casting. You can see that the actors put a lot of heart in their roles and on the plus side for this series is that everything was consulted and under the guidance of the creator himself ONE PIECE 9/10 series I recommend :)",05-Sep-23,10.0,didnt know anything world awesome time long time since series drew deeply world fascinated originality many ways even wanted see looked like original im fond manga anime beautiful atmosphere series big job done casting see actors put lot heart roles plus side series everything consulted guidance creator one piece series recommend
A Pleasant Surprise!,"I've never been a big fan of live-action adaptations of anime, but Netflix's take on ""One Piece"" truly exceeded my expectations. After binge-watching the first season, I can't help but share my thoughts.

From the get-go, it's evident that the creators poured their heart and soul into this project. The attention to detail in the set designs, the thrilling action sequences, and the surprising quality of the cast really stood out.

I√±aki Godoy's portrayal of Luffy was a highlight for me. Luffy's character can be a tough one to bring to life, but Godoy manages to capture the essence of the character's goofiness without making it overbearing. Other actors excel too!

Even though I've only watched a handful of One Piece episodes, I appreciated the unique direction they took with Buggy in episode 2. Jeff Ward's rendition of Buggy was genuinely terrifying, and the scene where he manipulates the crowd as prisoners had me on edge.

I was pleasantly surprised to see the iconic Shanks moment early in the series. It was executed well, and it showed that the creators were committed to staying true to the source material.

While the show occasionally veers into a slightly cartoony tone, it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment. My low expectations for live-action anime adaptations have been shattered, and I now have hope for future adaptations.

As we await future seasons, I can confidently say that Netflix's ""One Piece"" live action is a step in the right direction. It's not without its flaws, but it's a promising start that has the potential to pave the way for more successful anime adaptations.

In conclusion, if you're a One Piece fan or simply curious about the world of pirates and adventure, give this adaptation a chance. You might find yourself pleasantly surprised, just as I was.

Pretty good. Best anime live action made so far.,"To be honest, I went into this with insanely low expectations. And I have to say, I was insanely surprised. Although it's not exactly the same as the source material (which a lot of people online have been complaining about) it's still a really good adaptation. The cast is great, the changes in the plot are also great, everything about it is pretty good. The one thing I have an issue with is Zoro's acting, they definitely told him to act edgey and he does a good job at it but it's a little much at times. The fights are all great, cinematography is also great. Everything about this show is amazing. Would definitely recommend to everyone and anyone.",02-Sep-23,9.0,honest went insanely low expectations say insanely surprised although exactly source material lot people online complaining still really good adaptation cast great changes plot also great everything pretty good one thing issue zoros acting definitely told act edgey good job little much times fights great cinematography also great everything show amazing would definitely recommend everyone anyone

GREAT! But Could Be better,"First of all, people need to stop comparing it with the manga or the enemy. Clearly, lots of changes have been made, which has been also admitted by Oda (the author) in his message before the Debut.

Now as for the show, it completely took me by surprise, I loved it!! The casts interaction with each other reminds me 100% of the interactions from the anime!! Amazing jokes and 1 liners that most weren't cringy and genuinely funny.

My only issue (why I dropped a point) is Luffy's power. I hope in the next seasons, they can have a better way to animate his moves in a better way.

Overall= I Highly Recommend watching, for EVERYONE!",31-Aug-23,9.0,first people need stop comparing manga enemy clearly lots changes made also admitted oda author message debut show completely took surprise loved casts interaction reminds interactions anime amazing jokes liners werent cringy genuinely funny issue dropped point luffys power hope next seasons better way animate moves better way overall highly recommend watching everyone
"I don't watch anime, but I will probably watch this all the time.","I don't watch anime, but I will watch the live adaptation of One Piece until its end. Before the trolls start the witch hunt, it's not that I don't like anime, I just haven't tried to find an anime that holds my attention like it did in high school.

For One Piece (live adaptation) the story-telling hits high marks in so many ways. For one, the costume design and special fx prosthetics are insane for the first season. The show was well-casted and each actor did a great job setting themselves apart as individual and memorable characters. The story-telling is beyond expectations making each backstory as meaningful and memorable as the last. Not to forget that each scene carried significance throughout the episode so it never felt like the show had unnecessary fluff. This show has action, humor, varying life-themes, and hints at romance without having to lean on a romantic element to drive the main story. THANK YOU we are beyond that.

For someone who doesn't watch anime, you got me hooked on One Piece. Looking forward to the next season and waiting for Netflix to be able to stream the rest of the anime version so I can catch up.

When Author is passionate enough.,"Made this a account just to write the review after binge watching whole series.

This is what was missing from live action adaptation of comics and novels all thi while..a passionate author/mangaka who is as serious about live action as he was for his manga. And, isn't just after money from big studio but also after love of his fans.

What a series, trailers did disservice to this great adaptation. VFX, action, acting, story all in point.

I was worried given the reputation of Netflix and Hollywood elite converting everything in their own vision of cultist beliefs they hold, outside of real world. But thankfully Oda didn't take their sht and made this series epic.

"Thought it was impossible Dragon Ball Evolution, but they did it.","Like many people here I came in with pretty low expectations. The vast majority of anime live action adaptations are cringey at best even ones by Japanese studios and while it's true this show cannot quite capture Oda's world visually, it replicated its spirit and even its heart.

The show is pretty well paced especially compared to that atrocious Cowboy Bebop adaptation and succeeds in empathising the sense of scale to the world thanks to real sets despite some obvious green screen at times. Several cuts however hurt deeply, the Usopp Pirates, Jango, the Don Krieg saga and Hatchan were especially painful omissions with the faster pacing hurting the Baratie and Cocoyashi arcs which ironically needed more time to cook particularly the former. Being a couple of episodes longer definitely wouldn't hurt. Poor Merry getting definitely killed was sad.

The cast definitely definitely keep this ship afloat especially the main five and I was pleasantly surprised by several characters choices. Buggy being a more lighthearted Heath Ledger's Joker for one.

I√±aki Godoy's Luffy at first I found irritating but he quickly grew on me as he managed to find the right balance of Jack Sparrow eccentricity and heroic Shonen hero idiocy and passion. The joyful way he moves and fights is shockingly spot on. They managed to make the stretchiness work barring a few clunky CG moments. Wasn't bothered by the accent.

Mackenyu's Zoro I'm a little torn on, he gets the look of Zoro right and a lot of the mannerisms and it's very cool to see him slice and dice so bloodily but he did (whether intentionally or not) come off as a edgy cosplayer a lot of the time. It's was better to see his tough attitude poked fun at rather than played straight. His moments with Luffy, Nami and later Sanji were definite highlights as were the subtle bad direction gags.

Emily Rudd's Nami is a compelling paradox she's costumed as sexily as manga Nami with some suspect skirt shots but her personality is far more serious and real than her bodacious manga counterpart as she reacts to na√Øvet√© and flirtation with realistic aggravation. She's a deeply hurt person and the performance speaks to that. Glad she gets to kick more ass too, shame the weather forecasting didn't come up.

Jacob Gibso's Usopp is a lot of fun even if he did give me some Marlon Wayans in Dungeons and Dragons vibes here and there, I'm sad they didn't at least try the long nose, it wouldn't of been any less silly than the obviously dyed hair of other characters. Loved his stuff with Kaya (including a kiss) and his fight with Chu taken almost straight from the manga, hate how his stuff with Ninjin, Piiman and Tamanegi got left out.

Taz Skylar's Sanji is a strange beast but a charismatic & badass one, I knew they would have to downplay his horniness (especially towards Nami) to be more acceptable but the result may be that he's simply too cool rather having a interesting mixture of pathetic and awesome traits like in the manga. This more laidback and not hot-headed approach is surprisingly given how dark Sanji's background is. Awesome Bruce Lee-esque kick choreography in his fights, wish they had committed to the eyebrow.

Other favourite portrayals include Vincent Regan's Garp, Craig Fairbrass's Zeff, Peter Gadiot's Shanks and Steven John Ward's Mihawk. I know anime fans and newcomers alike will be confused over the power scaling how do the non-powered human characters do superhuman stuff one moment and realistically get hurt the next?

But anyways, if you're looking for something new and different this is the show for you.

Above my expectations !!!,"I never was able to watch the anime because of so many episodes it had and couldn't get the energy to start. After watching the live action of One Piece, I was surprised that this show was actually really good. Finally Netflix broke the curse of live action adaption of anime.

Must Watch for non Anime Watchers,"I started watching Live action without reading Comic or watching anime. Live action is very good and worth to watch. It's worth to invest 8 hours of our time.

It's Charming, funny and engaging through out the Series. It completes the East Blue Saga from Anime and Comic. Hopefully we will get every saga in live action as well. I'm not an Anime fan, so hoping to get the entire run in Live action. If we get all the 11 Sagas in live action, this might go as the greatest live action TV Series in Netflix history. Hopefully we will get there in next 10 years.

Casting is great and all of them acted wonderfully, especially Luffy and Nami.",02-Sep-23,10.0,started watching live action without reading comic watching anime live action good worth watch worth invest hours time charming funny engaging series completes east blue saga anime comic hopefully get every saga live action well im anime fan hoping get entire run live action get sagas live action might go greatest live action tv series netflix history hopefully get next years casting great acted wonderfully especially luffy nami
A big One Piece fan for more than 20 years,"At first I was afraid but now I'm very happy . Of course it's goofy . One Piece is goofy. Live action toned it down a lot already .

The casts are great . Humours are funny . Fighting scene is very good. CGI is acceptable .

I think for all beginners for the show , continue watching it till episode 3 you will start to love the characters . Godoy is very Luffy-like . Zoro was at first too emotionless for my liking But the best cast of all for me is Emily Rudd who plays Nami . She nailed it . One piece live action will get more and more difficult to adapt if we could get the next seasons . It will be the challenges for all the people who involved but I can't wait to watch next seasons of One Piece.",31-Aug-23,10.0,first afraid im happy course goofy one piece goofy live action toned lot already casts great humours funny fighting scene good cgi acceptable think beginners show continue watching till episode start love characters godoy luffylike zoro first emotionless liking best cast emily rudd plays nami nailed one piece live action get difficult adapt could get next seasons challenges people involved cant wait watch next seasons one piece
ONE PIECE LIVE ACTION,"I'm a huge One Piece fan and I was really afraid of the outcome of this adaptation, but I honestly think they did a great job considering the past live adaptations of other animes. However, here are the things that I think need to be worked on if they will move on to the next season(s), IMO:

Pacing - Pacing was too slow that I had to play it on 1.5x speed and still seemed to be playing it in normal. Tried it on 2x speed and I could still catch what is happening.

Cheesy Lines - I love some cheesy lines but it needs to be delivered on the right moments, and it needs to be toned down specially with luffy. One example was when luffy was trying to talk to zoro in his sleep when he's badly wounded after the fight with Mihawk. The scene was so melodramatic, I had to step outside for a minute to shake off the cringe. I really thought it was off luffy's character, even with the live action portrayal of luffy.

Editing - One meme has been circulating showing Zoro's scabbard bending during a fight scene. I know it is a minor thing, but if you are spending $17M per episode, there should be no room for silly mistakes like that.

Sound Scoring - This is one of the best thing that really captivated me with the anime which for me, is a bit lacking in the LA.

Overall, I really loved it. Can't wait for season 2.",02-Sep-23,10.0,im huge one piece fan really afraid outcome adaptation honestly think great job considering past live adaptations animes however things think need worked move next seasons imo pacing pacing slow play x speed still seemed playing normal tried x speed could still catch happening cheesy lines love cheesy lines needs delivered right moments needs toned specially luffy one example luffy trying talk zoro sleep hes badly wounded fight mihawk scene melodramatic step outside minute shake cringe really thought luffys character even live action portrayal luffy editing one meme circulating showing zoros scabbard bending fight scene know minor thing spending per episode room silly mistakes like sound scoring one best thing really captivated anime bit lacking la overall really loved cant wait season
Amazing live-action take on the anime!,"I am a huge fan of the anime and have literally watched every one of the 1073 episodes that have released so far. My wife, who watched this 2023 live-action series with me, has watched exactly zero episodes. So, the fact that both my wife and I give this a ""10"" says a lot.

First off, I want to set some expectations - Season 1 only covers the first 46 episodes. It covers it very closely, rarely deviating from the anime, so, if you are familiar with the One Piece manga or anime, you will find a familiar story (which is a great thing!).

When I heard about this coming out, I was excited, but pessimistic. Live-action remakes rarely do justice to the original material. Furthermore, when translating from a large amount of content and condensing down to a TV series, there is usually little room for character development or background. I was thoroughly impressed by what a fantastic job this TV series did of capturing the most important details and leaving out some of the superfluous details. I was also very impressed with how closely this follows the anime. To the director's and writers' credit, they changed very little while capturing the essence and fun of the anime. It's also worth mentioning that the episodes were split very well, giving you a little cliffhanger between every episode.

The casting, set design, CGI effects, and overall design hold true to the anime and do a wonderful job! Several times throughout our binge watch, I had to pause and bring up the anime for comparison. Both my wife and I were constantly impressed with what a good interpretation and design they did in this series.

In summary, I am so impressed with this series, that I resurrected my account just so that I could leave this review. Fantastic series and can't wait for Season 2!",03-Sep-23,10.0,huge fan anime literally watched every one episodes released far wife watched liveaction series watched exactly zero episodes fact wife give says lot first want set expectations season covers first episodes covers closely rarely deviating anime familiar one piece manga anime find familiar story great thing heard coming excited pessimistic liveaction remakes rarely justice original material furthermore translating large amount content condensing tv series usually little room character development background thoroughly impressed fantastic job tv series capturing important details leaving superfluous details also impressed closely follows anime directors writers credit changed little capturing essence fun anime also worth mentioning episodes split well giving little cliffhanger every episode casting set design cgi effects overall design hold true anime wonderful job several times throughout binge watch pause bring anime comparison wife constantly impressed good interpretation design series summary impressed series resurrected account could leave review fantastic series cant wait season
Short Review from a Die hard fan of One Piece.,"First of all, i don't generally post review for any show. Being a Die Hard fan of One Piece I liked it. Of course there are some things that makers cannot justify the anime in live action. But Overall 10/10 stars. Kudos to the maker they have done it. I was optimistic about this show and man they have delivered it. Those who think that they cannot watch/start anime because of too many episode. They should watch it and then decide it themselves if they want to watch the real thing or not. This live action adaptation of One piece have broken the curse of bad live adaptations. I recommend this show to all One Piece lovers.",02-Sep-23,10.0,first dont generally post review show die hard fan one piece liked course things makers cannot justify anime live action overall stars kudos maker done optimistic show man delivered think cannot watchstart anime many episode watch decide want watch real thing live action adaptation one piece broken curse bad live adaptations recommend show one piece lovers
A Heartfelt Voyage: 'Nostalgia and New Nuance',"For someone who has followed Luffy and his crew's journey for years, this adaptation is a delightful trip down memory lane. Nostalgic references and iconic moments are peppered throughout, eliciting smiles and even a few tears of joy. But what surprised me the most was the fresh perspective it offered. The adaptation manages to add new nuances to the story, enhancing the experience without compromising the original narrative.

This adaptation has rekindled my love for ""One Piece"" and has reinvigorated the sense of wonder and adventure that first drew me into this incredible world. It's a testament to the enduring power of Eiichiro Oda's creation and a reminder of why this story continues to resonate with fans worldwide.

EMBARRASSING,"What the hell is this? How could Oda partake in this. Its an insult to one of the greatest series ever created. Right from the start it was Redicilous. The start of one piece is slow and a great storytelling. Instead they cut everything and makes it dull.

I knew beforehand that the cgi would never handle this so they should focus on the story, it's what makes one piece great.

Instead there is no character buildup, nothing. Watch it if you wanna have a good laugh.

There is really nothing more to say to this. Instead of spending a fortune on cgi and making a long character building Tv show, they create yet another Redicilous live action show. Pretty stereotypical.",04-Sep-23,5.0,hell could oda partake insult one greatest series ever created right start redicilous start one piece slow great storytelling instead cut everything makes dull knew beforehand cgi would never handle focus story makes one piece great instead character buildup nothing watch wanna good laugh really nothing say instead spending fortune cgi making long character building tv show create yet another redicilous live action show pretty stereotypical
Almost as good as the anime,"As someone who saw around 80 episodes of the anime before but was on hold, I wasn't really impressed with the first episode. The way they tried balancing the aesthetics with a lot of practical effects looked weird. It kind of reminded me of old TV shows. Adding to that some emotional scenes being cut short initially made me not so interested in it. But as more positive reviews started coming on, I decided to try it again and it was well worth it. The way this series used so much practical effects and made the aesthetics and tone work is incredible. Inaki Godoy as Luffy is the perfect casting that made me believe this world works like this. He's different from the anime yet shows the spirit of it. Obviously, there was a lot of stuff that wasn't as good as the anime. And even though it only covers under 60 episodes of anime, it mixed up some stuff that would come way later which spoiler a few stuff for me in the anime. But this made me want to watch the anime again and I restarted it. The cast has been incredible. Zoro is great, Sanji is also pretty great. Nami's actress did an incredible job of showing how she's hiding her emotions. Usopp was perfect in the sense it gave the anime feel but it wasn't as annoying. In fact, it was one of the things that worked way better than the anime. That whole syrup village story was way better even though the anime had some cool fights. Overall, this had a lot of stuff in it that actually did a better job than anime even though there are many that don't. So up until the point it covers in the anime, it's almost as good as the anime for me.",21-Sep-23,7.0,someone saw around episodes anime hold wasnt really impressed first episode way tried balancing aesthetics lot practical effects looked weird kind reminded old tv shows adding emotional scenes cut short initially made interested positive reviews started coming decided try well worth way series used much practical effects made aesthetics tone work incredible inaki godoy luffy perfect casting made believe world works like hes different anime yet shows spirit obviously lot stuff wasnt good anime even though covers episodes anime mixed stuff would come way later spoiler stuff anime made want watch anime restarted cast incredible zoro great sanji also pretty great namis actress incredible job showing shes hiding emotions usopp perfect sense gave anime feel wasnt annoying fact one things worked way better anime whole syrup village story way better even though anime cool fights overall lot stuff actually better job anime even though many dont point covers anime almost good anime
A good start,"First of all, live action is a real challenge. Kingdom live action is not bad at best even it is more suitable for cinema. So there are some problems but overall it is good. Fishmen are not good. They are terribly designed. Luffy was good at the beginning but after watching last episodes I thought it would been better. Sanji and Zoro are perfect. Nami is good. Usopp is the man. Perfectly adapted. I dont like serious Garp. Mohawk and Shanks not bad. Buggy is perfect. Fight scenes are perfect. Especially Sanji and Zoro parts were beautiful.

WOW,"Very enjoyable and great fun!

There are some things that quiet didn't land for me like the whole garp subplot but as a whole really enjoyed.

Characters were all great as a whole.

The fights were all great but the final fight with arlong's crew were a bit rushed. The ussop fight was a bit flat.

The backstory of first five straw hats were fantastic. Actually showing where zeff cut his leg off was brutal but all good.

The storyline of One Piece-manga and anime alike-is commonly divided into individual story arcs for easier understanding.

The show was actually brutal than the manga and the anime.

The zoro nearly died plot went for a bit too long.",05-Sep-23,9.0,enjoyable great fun things quiet didnt land like whole garp subplot whole really enjoyed characters great whole fights great final fight arlongs crew bit rushed ussop fight bit flat backstory first five straw hats fantastic actually showing zeff cut leg brutal good storyline one piecemanga anime alikeis commonly divided individual story arcs easier understanding show actually brutal manga anime zoro nearly died plot went bit long
DIFFERENT MEDIA MEANS DIFFERENT STORYTELLING APPROACHES.,"Just because there are many scenes in the manga that aren't accurate in the show, doesn't mean the storytelling is bad.

People who like to compare stuff should get that different media needs different ways to tell stories. But the main story still matches up well with the anime and manga.

This is one way for people who want to get into the world of One Piece but don't have the time to read thousands of manga chapters or watch all it's anime episodes.

Even though reading the manga's probably the best way to get all the emotions and messages from the creator, Eiichiro Oda.

To me, this is one of the best adaptations since Rurouni Kenshin. It'll be fun waiting to see more characters in the next seasons!.",01-Sep-23,,many scenes manga arent accurate show doesnt mean storytelling bad people like compare stuff get different media needs different ways tell stories main story still matches well anime manga one way people want get world one piece dont time read thousands manga chapters watch anime episodes even though reading mangas probably best way get emotions messages creator eiichiro oda one best adaptations since rurouni kenshin itll fun waiting see characters next seasons
Pros and cons of op live action,"The story line is good so far. It isn't as accurate as one might think but (G)Oda sets it up VERY nice. The fights seem good, and the devil fruits are actually set up pretty well which was my biggest concern. Luffy a stretch is actually done well. My biggest cons are the acting in a lot of these scenes are a bit garbage (mainly fighting) and this isn't all fight scenes. The punches and hits are a bit dumb to me. It's a little hard to get past the flaky fight scenes but it's doable with the story building.

I personally like the bit of blood and cussing to make it a bit more realistic and not just for kid audiences.

One piece anime was funnier so far as of now. I feel like the characters except Nami try too hard. The person playing Nami seems to play her character well.

Full disclosure I think someone who likes pirates and is in for something new and is (okay with a bit of bad acting) will be alright but I think most adults would drop the show within the first ep. If not PERFECT.",02-Sep-23,8.0,story line good far isnt accurate one might think goda sets nice fights seem good devil fruits actually set pretty well biggest concern luffy stretch actually done well biggest cons acting lot scenes bit garbage mainly fighting isnt fight scenes punches hits bit dumb little hard get past flaky fight scenes doable story building personally like bit blood cussing make bit realistic kid audiences one piece anime funnier far feel like characters except nami try hard person playing nami seems play character well full disclosure think someone likes pirates something new okay bit bad acting alright think adults would drop show within first ep perfect
A Good Live Action Adaptation.,"I must say I actually Enjoyed all 8 episodes. The Anime has over 1000 episodes so it isn't possible to include every minor details in the show,if you will watch it as a normal series then you all will 100% enjoy it. If you are gonna cry about why this isn't included why that isn't included,then it's not for you. They took the mainstory line and made the show. The Creator of One piece too had worked on the show and didn't changed the storyline. The Casting is on point,The makeup was on point,the screenplay was very well written,the costume was on point and VFX was on Point too.

This show isn't too fast paced or too slow. The pace is balanced and If the continue to make One Piece then I guess they can wrap up one piece in 6-7 seasons.",01-Sep-23,8.0,must say actually enjoyed episodes anime episodes isnt possible include every minor details showif watch normal series enjoy gonna cry isnt included isnt includedthen took mainstory line made show creator one piece worked show didnt changed storyline casting pointthe makeup pointthe screenplay well writtenthe costume point vfx point show isnt fast paced slow pace balanced continue make one piece guess wrap one piece seasons

Awesome adaptation.,"I love One Piece and the live action adaptation is awesome. The story is well put together for the short amount of screen time given for every arc. The characters are cool and the effects are top notch.

The episodes still manage to get you into tears, even if you don't spend 20-30 episodes on each character's beninnings story.

I love how they set the mood. Loofy is Loofy and that's all this series pretty much needed in order for it to be a success.

I don't mind them bringing Garp in early on, even though the story gets a bit mixed up, but we do get to see that he's a good guy, who loves his grandson.",14-Sep-23,10.0,love one piece live action adaptation awesome story well put together short amount screen time given every arc characters cool effects top notch episodes still manage get tears even dont spend episodes characters beninnings story love set mood loofy loofy thats series pretty much needed order success dont mind bringing garp early even though story gets bit mixed get see hes good guy loves grandson

Don't fulfill expectations for anime viewers.,"A lot of change in storyline from anime series. A bit more serious than anime because anime series has comic scenes.

A lot of major scene or dialogue are missing without them it's not has essence of one piece.

1. Shanks dialogue-"" put your life on line these are not for threatening"" is not shown.

2. Buggy ball scene is absent.

3. Luffy laugh in cage as prisoner of buggy is absent.

4. Shanks and buggy flashabck is absent.

5. How koby meets garp is changed .

6. Whole buggy arc is changed.

Too much change in storyline from anime. That's reason it lost one piece essence. Few cast are good and few are bad. Bad vfx in arlong. Seeing arlong feels violated.

The story drags and is nothing special,"I knew nothing of the original, so my review does not come from any earlier experience. The series is a entertaining watch, & if I were 12, likely enough of a story. As an adult, the story is simple & drawn out needlessly. What takes eight episodes could have easily been done in 4, and the story begins to drag. Although I understand the goofy nature of the story since it comes from a anime origin, the live action version begins to enter into the realm of being annoying. You get to that point of saying, ""is it done yet?"" It is also sad that the show, like so many, is dependent on a season 2. Hopefully season 2 will pick up the pace and increase the depth of storytelling.",18-Sep-23,7.0,knew nothing original review come earlier experience series entertaining watch likely enough story adult story simple drawn needlessly takes eight episodes could easily done story begins drag although understand goofy nature story since comes anime origin live action version begins enter realm annoying get point saying done yet also sad show like many dependent season hopefully season pick pace increase depth storytelling
It was worth the wait!,"Alright so, I am going to come out and say that I have not finished this show yet. I did watch the first episode last night when it came out and I currently am on episode 4. So far I am pleased with this show. Yes, there are parts that seem a bit lacking but for the most part the Straw Hats I see so far are working well. The lighting and idk maybe some scenes are eh but most great shows usually end up taking a season to work out the kinks and they have ended up being really good. I have faith in this piece and I think that as the show progresses and as the seasons will progress (PLEASE GIVE US MORE) that this show is going to do very well. It already seems inspiring and ai can get behind these Straw Hats and some of the other characters.

I have to say that ah the annoying Marine with the metal jaw (I never remember his name)....his fight with Luffy and Zorro was lacking. His ax arm was almost as big as him and the way they had him move wasn't very scary. Unlike the anime he was not scary and I'm sure that he was seriously hard to pull off. Anime villians can be intimidatingand not very realistic. I'm glad they tried even though it was hard. As for the lights, I feel like somethings missing. It could even be the camera that threw me off at times. I'm not entirely sure what was wrong but I know that something felt a bit lacking in depth for the circus. I know the actors did their best but I feel like something just was making it feel more like a play then a show.

The other villians so far that I've ran into seem more legit, not that the Marine was not. When he had a close up he seemed fine. That fight just made me feel like something was missing. They probably could have had a better fight scene but Luffy and Zorro did good in it from my perspective. I like the settings, costumes (besides that butler jaket for Kuro that looked cosplayish) characters, Den Den Mushi and the entire vibe of this show so far. The acting of the Straw Hats was actually pretty good. Nami wasn't just a grouchy thief, I have yet to see Zorror get lost, Luffy was his fun optimistic and expected chewing gum self and Usopp wasn't crying boogers and overly weird. I think that they did a good job at not trying to recreate the cartoon vibe too much that it becomes ridiculous. I look forward to watching more of this show and I think the next season will do better.

Surprisingly good!,"Best show seen for a long time. I've only seen two of the movies of the the whole anime/ manga franchise, so I'm not a real connaisseur.

But I really really liked everything about the first 8 episodes: Great characters you learn about piece by piece, great narration with a mix of suspense, in-depth of characters and action and an overall great entertainment for the whole family with the fun aspect of the series: Super powers, strange characters, a lot of jokes. And a big mission.

Last but not least, it's an impressive story about following your dreams and self-realization of adolescents, of hubris of former victims becoming offenders. This is realized in an obvious, exaggerated, but impressive and never invasive way.

Really looking forward for season two of the show!",05-Sep-23,10.0,best show seen long time ive seen two movies whole anime manga franchise im real connaisseur really really liked everything first episodes great characters learn piece piece great narration mix suspense indepth characters action overall great entertainment whole family fun aspect series super powers strange characters lot jokes big mission last least impressive story following dreams selfrealization adolescents hubris former victims becoming offenders realized obvious exaggerated impressive never invasive way really looking forward season two show
"As someone who watched the original series for 1070 episodes,","This series was good but it felt strange and incomplete if they were about a side story from the one piece universe, it would be much better if they wrote the life of someone in any village, the film would be quite good in terms of shooting techniques.........One Piece's main story shouldn't be the subject because it feels awful to have the chapters cut short.........The villager I mentioned may even be someone who was seen just passing by his grave in the current episode, which we have never seen in the original series, or he may be someone who fought and was defeated by Luffy but whose main story we do not know much about.",31-Aug-23,5.0,series good felt strange incomplete side story one piece universe would much better wrote life someone village film would quite good terms shooting techniquesone pieces main story shouldnt subject feels awful chapters cut shortthe villager mentioned may even someone seen passing grave current episode never seen original series may someone fought defeated luffy whose main story know much
Don't even like One Piece but this was pretty fine,"You know, I never got into the One Piece anime because it just felt like a waste of time. I tried the manga, liked a couple hundred chapters, and then just felt like I was losing interest in the characters and their adventures because it was just the usual""boy gets strong and fights the power"" type of show. I never read the whole thing (is it still ongoing? Who knows) and I thought I was going to find the One Piece live action boring and stupid, but I didn't!

The characters are pretty solid, there are some differences with the manga (duh, of course there would be!) but I'm not a crybaby who needs everything to remain the same, so if a character's skin color changes, and that's not ruining the story, then I'm capable of just ignoring that and focusing on the positive. The CGI is pretty good, if you are not familiar with the original work you might think ""how is a clown floating in the air?"" but hey, that's the way the character is introduced in the manga, and I think they did a great job with the adaptation. It's not goofy CGI, it's pretty good.

Honestly, I would watch a 2nd season of this. My only complain would have to be...I wish they had remained loyal to the physique of the ladies in the show. They are a bit...smaller...

Oh, also: The voice actor that dubs Sanji into Spanish...god, his accent is awful.

It's always been a gargantuam task by itself to start it, but this live action - by god is the best ever.

"It deserves all the praise, whether you're a One Piece fan or not!","After watching a plethora of live-adaptations for many stories and animes, this is the only series that comes close to perfection. It is not perfect, but it certainly lives up to the hype, and surely does a pretty good job delivering one of the most entertaining stories in Anime to real television.

The pacing is on point, it may feel rushed to those who are used to the anime's pace, but the flow in this series delivers everything on the right timing. Every single actor studied their characters pretty well, especially the main ones, we felt for the characters, they had way more depth even than when they were introduced in the anime, which I believe is a perk of having a live adaptation rather than just plain animation.

However, I believe there should be some consistency in the gore-like delivery, for example, some fights are pretty bloody, and some other fights are unreasonably ""blood-less"" ?

Anyway, Luffy doesn't look too braindead in this series, I am pretty sure this brings One Piece to a whole new taste and dimension, I certainly would rewatch it some time, and I can't wait for Season 2 !",08-Oct-23,10.0,watching plethora liveadaptations many stories animes series comes close perfection perfect certainly lives hype surely pretty good job delivering one entertaining stories anime real television pacing point may feel rushed used animes pace flow series delivers everything right timing every single actor studied characters pretty well especially main ones felt characters way depth even introduced anime believe perk live adaptation rather plain animation however believe consistency gorelike delivery example fights pretty bloody fights unreasonably bloodless anyway luffy doesnt look braindead series pretty sure brings one piece whole new taste dimension certainly would rewatch time cant wait season
Well shot live action free for all.,"Wow... this is phenomenal. Not in a cheesy way, I am floored by how good it was. There was some pacing issues in some episodes but that might just be my own preference.

The main character was acted so well that everyone around him seemed to be at peace. This seems like a good group of people for a show just because of how they jelled together. I sincerely hope they get another season or 20 because they deserve it.

I will have to rewatch it and the animation to try to find flaws but flabbergasted would be the term as of now.

Great cinematography, good character arcs mixed in with action, the fight scenes were well choreographed. I really appreciate that they didn't make the female just some love interest but an essential part of the crew. You know, like real life...

I sincerely hope other people attune to this series as much as I have as I really want to see what these writers and actors can do going forwards.

The villains were so good... So many characters to work with, it's like an good book where you can pick a random page blindfolded and fall into a rabbit hole of interest.

A TV show for adults that never grew up.,"This TV show has the feel of a children's story combined with violent and bloody scenes. All the characters are immature and shallow. They all have weird hair colors and the men look feminine. The villain in the first episode is an over weight chick that smashes grown man by swinging her dumb, bird mallet. Are you kidding me? She's the least threatening looking villain in TV show history. She honestly looks like she would be out of breath from lifting anything half as heavy.

I truly worry about the future of our culture, where men now have to be weak and feminine.

I loved it.,"I was not sure while watching the first episode. Or maybe the second, but I fell hard til I Rachel the end. I haven't seen the anime itself though.

It was just like watching an anime. The whole thing, the characters, the character development, the story. Obviously it's not real-life like.

I liked the flashbacks - those were a bit better timed than usually in an anime.

I don't know how they did it, but the actors were so beautiful and symmetrical that it seemed natural but unreal. They looked like drawn characters. Everyone.

Overall really good but it's rushing through the story,"They turned one of the most beloved mangas/ animes into Live-Action and almost everyone was rightfully skeptical. Now comes the surprise: It's actually well done! But the fact that they condensed a complex long-form story into 8 episodes creates some problems. If you know the original, the pace is just too quick. That leads to some moments falling a bit flat.

Acting:

+The main actors do a great job of portraying the animated counterparts - faces and mannerisms are spot on

+After over 20 years the German dub still has most of the original voice actors - very nostalgic!

+The casting can't be praised enough - almost every character was visually translated near perfectly into live action

Script:

+They recreated the tone of the original: adventurous, epic, goofy, emotional and sometimes pretty graphic and brutal

-To fit the story of the East blue saga into 8 episodes they had to condense and leave out certain plot lines, which leads to: ->some missing side characters that brought a lot of personality ->emotional payoffs and reveals not having as much weight since there is not enough time to establish them properly: e.g. Characters backstories, foreshadowing of big baddies, Namis betrayal
> too much screen time for Corby
-> certain plot points not being as plausible due to some missing exposition: e.g. Why would captain black let Kayra live until she is 18? Why is captain Morgan captured by Garp?

+The shortening and adjustment of the story for live action also led to some positive changes like interesting new character interactions that weren't in the Anime /Manga and scenes that were only talked about before

VfX/SfX:

+You can see where the budget went: CGI, set pieces and choreographies are high quality

-even with a huge budget they had to scale down some epic battles in size: e.g.captain black fight without his crew and only inside the mansion, no Don Creek with his crew at the barratie

+Set pieces are designed in a very colorful and fantastical way, almost like a Tim Burton Movie

-The visuals can tend to be a bit to cartoony at points though - they also went a bit too far with the modern stuff that pulled me out a few times: e.g. Having ghetto blasters in Arlong Park

-The soundtrack is really mediocre and pales in comparison the wonderful orchestral OST of the Anime - at points it even pulled me out a bit by adding Hip-Hop Beats every time Along appears

Direction:

+Interesting shots are mixed in to further substantiate the quirkiness of the universe and it's anime roots, e g. Cross cuts, wanted poster presentations

-But they could also be considered a bit distracting at times.",10-Sep-23,8.0,turned one beloved mangas animes liveaction almost everyone rightfully skeptical comes surprise actually well done fact condensed complex longform story episodes creates problems know original pace quick leads moments falling bit flat acting main actors great job portraying animated counterparts faces mannerisms spot years german dub still original voice actors nostalgic casting cant praised enough almost every character visually translated near perfectly live action script recreated tone original adventurous epic goofy emotional sometimes pretty graphic brutal fit story east blue saga episodes condense leave certain plot lines leads missing side characters brought lot personality emotional payoffs reveals much weight since enough time establish properly eg characters backstories foreshadowing big baddies namis betrayal much screen time corby certain plot points plausible due missing exposition eg would captain black let kayra live captain morgan captured garp shortening adjustment story live action also led positive changes like interesting new character interactions werent anime manga scenes talked vfxsfx see budget went cgi set pieces choreographies high quality even huge budget scale epic battles size egcaptain black fight without crew inside mansion creek crew barratie set pieces designed colorful fantastical way almost like tim burton movie visuals tend bit cartoony points though also went bit far modern stuff pulled times eg ghetto blasters arlong park soundtrack really mediocre pales comparison wonderful orchestral ost anime points even pulled bit adding hiphop beats every time along appears direction interesting shots mixed substantiate quirkiness universe anime roots e g cross cuts wanted poster presentations could also considered bit distracting times

READ MANGA,"If you are a reader of the manga, the series is also nice to watch, you can overlook the plot holes, the inconsistency of the psychology of the characters. The problem arises when a person sees the live action without having seen the manga, the one piece experience is totally ruined.

The TV series is really bad, but it saves for some nice things the problem is that it rewrites some details that change the psychology of the characters and create plot holes, so a neophyte of the world of one piece watching the live action ruins his manga which is easily considered a CONTEMPORARY ODYSSEY. Oda I don't know why he approved this work but read the manga first... the series adapts the first 10 volumes is the only way to fully enjoy ONE PIECE.",01-Sep-23,2.0,reader manga series also nice watch overlook plot holes inconsistency psychology characters problem arises person sees live action without seen manga one piece experience totally ruined tv series really bad saves nice things problem rewrites details change psychology characters create plot holes neophyte world one piece watching live action ruins manga easily considered contemporary odyssey oda dont know approved work read manga first series adapts first volumes way fully enjoy one piece
Worst and best alternative,"This is the worst alternative in the One Piece universe. Both the manga and the anime are much better options to experience the story which has captured the hearts of millions worldwide.

However, as a live action, it is probably among the best options out there. It won't follow the story, but stray away from it and try other things. And it rarely works, but in the case of One Piece it is acceptable, which puts it among the top tiers of live action category.

Something positive is that the forced Netflix diversity casting is not harming the series. Since it is a world where most travel around on ships and access is there for long travel, it is not that weird that each village is somewhat mixed and diverse. Each crew with mixed nationalities also looks completely natural since bad eggs will come from all over the world, and band together to steal and kill.

Of course, that is not what the strawhats pirate clan do. Since these are the good ones out to mainly fulfill their dreams and goals. The cast for the crew is great, although I can't avoid complaining that Usopp doesn't have his long nose which is the centerpiece in multiple gags and jokes through the series. I'll survive without those jokes in future seasons, but it will make the series worse.

The CG effects are really good, which are necessary for a series that is essentially pirate mages. (Although instead of spells, it is devil fruit powers). I was never disappointed at the sea monsters, environments and so on. Each location was faithfully recreated by a cast and staff that seem to seriously care about the series. Let's hope Netflix and the producers also love it and continue to do good seasons.

As for parts that made me lower the score and think they made poor choices in the writing apart from Usopps nose would be the following:


Arlong looking for a map of the grand line to go there and enslave the humans. Anyone knowing the lore would know that Arlong was in this region just because he came from the grand line and wanted to enslave weak humans, while the grand line had too many strong humans for him to accomplish this. This plot change made no sense.



Luffy eating poison. The only times in the manga he has really been close to dying, were all times he got poisoned. He doesn't have any poison resist until after those near-death occasions. That the live action just lets him eat poison, be sleepy, then throw it up and be fine again, is not fitting with the lore.



Don Krieg got cut a bit too much. While it was OK that he fought Mihawk instead, it was disappointing that it wasn't properly explained that he had plenty of powerful tools like a diamond cape, gas bombs and so on. There was a reason he was a big name pirate, and the live action fails to tell the story.



Cutting the hypnotism subordinate of the cat pirate clan. Made us miss out on the possibility of the two crewmen (I guess one was a woman) to power up through hypnotism. Not a big deal, but a lost chance at showing how strong Zoro is.


I hope they can continue to deliver a good show. I'm mainly worried about minor things like.

1. They might not make Arvida thin after eating the smooth fruit, because they worry about body positivity activists.

2. They might forget diversity casting when we get to Alabasta, and every single actor will suddenly be black because ""It is a sandy area so naturally no white people would be here"".

But overall I think they might be able to keep going with a good story. Hopefully giving us the whole alabasta arc next season.

A fun adventure,"I've been a fan of the One Piece anime for years and when I heard that Netflix was making a live action adaptation I shuddered when I considered their previous offerings but Netflix stepped up this time and made an entertaining and faithful adaptation.

The entire cast delivers their lines with the same chaotic energy of a well performed pantomime that embraced the downright campy nonsense of the source material. Hardcore, and perhaps even toxic, fans won't like the creative liberties and story rearranging they ended up doing but I think it works for a western audience who might not have the patience for the pacing of a typical battler anime story. So, to make the story flow better, certain story moments from later in the series were integrated nicely into the first season such as:


Garp being introduced and the revelation that he's Luffy's Grandfather.



Coby is in pretty much every episode as we see him adapt to life as a Marine cadet with the insanely rude but likeable Helmeppo.



Garp agreeing to train Coby and Helmeppo personally.



Buggy is in six of the eight episodes to some capacity but doesn't really overstay his welcome.


Despite some of the crazier aspects of One Piece being toned down it still has some very anime moments like the zany villains, people shouting out attacks (which is so campy, I love it) and the incredibly ridiculous hairstyles of characters.

I did say that I liked how it felt like a well produced pantomime but, as fun as that is, it can also detract from the quality of the show especially when characters would do attacks in the air. It wasn't enough to ruin how cool these fights are though. I also feel like the abailities of some non-fruit users, such as Garp or Shanks, should have been explained. As it is Garp just lobs a cannonball better than a cannon and Shanks scares away a Sea Beast with a firm look and a hard 'get lost' with no explination as to how these seemingly normal humans did this. While longtime fans might know the reasons, first time watchers will be left confused.

I feel like Coby could have asked Garp after he threw the cannonball.

""How did you do that sir?"" Coby says as he watches the cannoball splash into the water.

""Do what Cadet?"" Garp says as he cracks his knuckles.

""Throw that cannonball so far, and so fast!""

""DId you think eating some cursed fruit was the only path to power, Cadet?"" Garp says with a grin, patting Coby hard on the shoulder.

That would have let new viewers know there's something different to Devil Fruits that normal humans can use to fight.

I was hoping for something perfect....,"I would describe this series as a low budget, amateur, live action adaptation of the anime. If you are a One Piece fan you will both love it because you are blinded by the nostalgia and excitement this live-action show brings and cringe from the subpar acting, poor fight scenes, nasty fishmen makeup, butchered characters and a rushed and altered story.

Before watching an episode my thoughts on the cast's appearances were:

Luffy: skin too dark, hair too curly, too old, eyebrows too thick

Zoro: too young and immature looking, could be a little bigger

Sanji: eyebrows not curly enough, face too clean shaven

Nami: a little old, doesn't have Nami's unrealistic proportions which is fair, cute but not cute enough

Usopp: lol ok nose aside, he should be skinner and have more hair like an afro

After watching a few episodes:

The cringing starts.

Luffy is not silly or enthusiastic enough, has a weird accent. Almost always has this same smiley face. Acting is just 5/10.

Zoro doesn't use his 3rd sword much and his acting is so bland. His face almost never changes. Always muttering. Acting 2/10

Sanji has way too much upper body muscle. Does not go all gaagaa over girls which is well, just not Sanji.

Nami has good acting but is too serious all the time.

Usopp is ok.

The characters are all too serious. Too stiff. The humor is missing. There's never a silly moment like in the anime.

We are seeing Koby an awful lot as well and his face also never changes. It's almost starting to get tiring seeing him and Garp. Also Garp is nothing like his funny anime character. He seems happy and angry at the same time, I can't tell what he's trying to express. Why does he have a Scottish accent? Do they expect me to believe he is Luffy's grandpa when they have nothing in common? He's been in every single episode which is just too much.

Stunts and fights are very amateur-ish. You can see them hold back or slow down. They use the camera cut/character knock back effect way too often or show hits from the back. In some fights they are clearly aiming at the ground. I am waiting for some really good action but before I know it, the fight is over. A little disappointing. Honestly, there are better fight scenes in fan-made videos on youtube.

The side characters' cosplays look really good. Some not so good (Shanks) but most are pretty awesome. But acting is still rather poor.

They are not following the original story word for word which is understandable since it would be too long and they don't have enough actors for every single enemy crew member. They are taking interesting twists and shortcuts to reach the same outcome which sucks but is understandable.

After watching all 8 episodes:

As a One Piece fan I still enjoyed it. It was really nice finally hearing the We Are instrumental in episode 4 and at the end I was feeling happy but is it because of this show? Or is it because it's bringing back my memories of the OP anime/manga?

This series was really low budget and the characters are pretty far from the originals. Their unique personalities were lost and destroyed. This show is less funny, less emotional and has less action. I don't know why people are giving it anything higher than 7. For me, I'll give it a 7 because I love OP. It could have been so much more.

I binged this,"Oh boy, where to begin. I started reading One Piece as a manga several years ago but never got into it. I watched it as an anime but never got into it. I have watched other franchises get live action movies and seen them fail, but this... This hit differently.

The point of my intro was to state that no I am not a fan of One Piece in itself and therefore will give it high ratings no matter what. I actually fell off the manga way before the storyline that was told in this series.

However, this series is special. All those times you've seen someone try to replicate a manga/anime and fail? This series learnt from it.

Monkh D. Luffy is believably played. All supporting cast got an actual personality. The stories makes sense. And even the marine (¬´Good guys¬ª) is not like a chore to watch, it's entertaining.

The storylines is actually built. You follow them, you will most likely get invested.

This series is a must watch for anyone that enjoys this particular type of story, manga or is sinply a fan of One Piece. It manages to avoid the common pit falls of other live action adopted manga, and is actually pushing boundaries.

But as a credit to both writers, directors and what not; the ¬´Help me¬ª-scene in episode 7 hits diffferently. It is replicated almost 1:1 from the manga without losing detail, and... wow. We were 4 guys watching it and all of us admitted to crying during the end of episode 7.

Tldr; great watch, go for it. This series avoids almost all tropes and pitfalls of similar types of series.",17-Sep-23,10.0,oh boy begin started reading one piece manga several years ago never got watched anime never got watched franchises get live action movies seen fail hit differently point intro state fan one piece therefore give high ratings matter actually fell manga way storyline told series however series special times youve seen someone try replicate mangaanime fail series learnt monkh luffy believably played supporting cast got actual personality stories makes sense even marine good guys like chore watch entertaining storylines actually built follow likely get invested series must watch anyone enjoys particular type story manga sinply fan one piece manages avoid common pit falls live action adopted manga actually pushing boundaries credit writers directors help mescene episode hits diffferently replicated almost manga without losing detail wow guys watching us admitted crying end episode tldr great watch go series avoids almost tropes pitfalls similar types series
Good but Corny,"This is well produced, shot, acted, etc. Overall, it's well done, but why is it made with 30-year-olds behaving and acting like children? It gives it a really odd and corny feel. It's like they wanted to make a kids' show, but wanted adults to watch it, so instead of using kids, they used adults acting like kids. It's bizarre and doesn't really work for me. Like a lot of their lines are straight up things a 5-year-old would say coming out of the mouth of an adult and it's weird. It works and makes sense if you think of the characters as kids, so why didn't they just use kids?

It's weird to me, but I also think adults collecting children's toys, dressing up to go to movies, and furry conventions are weird. So maybe that's the target audience? Age regressive adults who like acting and talking like children? I don't know, but it didn't work for me.",28-Sep-23,6.0,well produced shot acted etc overall well done made yearolds behaving acting like children gives really odd corny feel like wanted make kids show wanted adults watch instead using kids used adults acting like kids bizarre doesnt really work like lot lines straight things yearold would say coming mouth adult weird works makes sense think characters kids didnt use kids weird also think adults collecting childrens toys dressing go movies furry conventions weird maybe thats target audience age regressive adults like acting talking like children dont know didnt work
one garbage not one piece,"First, I will talk about acting. I have never seen a character better at acting than Jeff Ward, the actor of Buggy As for the directing, it was one of the worst. I had high hopes for it. Also, the combat scenes were like childish scenes. There were a lot of behind-the-scenes effects, such as ropes and plastic swords. So stop lying and saying that it is a wonderful series. It was a bad series. We do not want to live in the era of trivial and childish series I hope the staff and actors do not believe that they did a wonderful job. No, you did not. You were completely bad.

Its great,"Im a hardcore one piece fan and has loved it since i was like 10 years old. When i saw that this was going to be release i was quite skeptical because of how some of the other live action anime adaptations have been but this was truly stunning. But i do have a few reasons to why its not as great as the original. First of they stray a bit from what happens in the actual series like for example, when luffy fights buggy in the series it is not done as quickly as it is in the show and they also fight the green/blacked hair dude who i dont remeber the name of but is featured for a while in the show but very short and also the lion tamer who is only shown for about 1 scene. I guess this is kinda nitpicky but you know.. im a hardcore fan whos read it twice and watched once. And also from what i can remeber atleast zoro is not as arrogant as he is in the live adaption.",04-Sep-23,8.0,im hardcore one piece fan loved since like years old saw going release quite skeptical live action anime adaptations truly stunning reasons great original first stray bit happens actual series like example luffy fights buggy series done quickly show also fight greenblacked hair dude dont remeber name featured show short also lion tamer shown scene guess kinda nitpicky know im hardcore fan whos read twice watched also remeber atleast zoro arrogant live adaption

Bgm music is best.

For season 1 this is good They're are going to make s2 more better then this.

For non one piece fans they will also enjoy this show ‚úÖ One thing we have to forget that live action series And anime is very deferent.

Some story and some things is not gonna work on live action so they cut it out from the Netflix series.

This feels like a Love Letter,"Okay, so I haven't read/watched the original in long time but this made me feel like I did the first time I saw a One Piece episode. It was slow at one or two points (Usopps episodes), which is why I didn't give it a ten out of ten but this show was a fun watch.

The cast is fantastic and I can't say enough about how much each of the actors portrayed their characters.

The writers have handled changes to the story well, in my opinion. Obviously it's not going to be beat for beat to the manga/anime and so far the way the live action has added in major plot threads early has felt natural.

I know that Netflix is banking on this show to be a hit but it really does feel like a passion project over a blatant cash grab.",03-Sep-23,9.0,okay havent readwatched original long time made feel like first time saw one piece episode slow one two points usopps episodes didnt give ten ten show fun watch cast fantastic cant say enough much actors portrayed characters writers handled changes story well opinion obviously going beat beat mangaanime far way live action added major plot threads early felt natural know netflix banking show hit really feel like passion project blatant cash grab
This was the best anime live adaptation I've watch,"This show was extremally good. This show how an anime live adaptation should be done showing love to original source material and the fans. Also get the creator and his team on board and getting to show him scene to approve he like them and if he didn't they would refilm it until he was satisfied which was honestly a good choice.

This nailed every of my expectations from VFX, acting, the fight scenes, costumes, structures, and the show it self on how well it written with some change which still worked. This was just wow everything is just wow.

I cant wait for season 2 and I'm already on board with more season. Netflix we want more seasons now.",01-Sep-23,10.0,show extremally good show anime live adaptation done showing love original source material fans also get creator team board getting show scene approve like didnt would refilm satisfied honestly good choice nailed every expectations vfx acting fight scenes costumes structures show self well written change still worked wow everything wow cant wait season im already board season netflix want seasons
I've never seen a single One Piece episode . . .,"I've never seen a single One Piece episode..............and I don't intend to watch the series of 1000 episodes! So I'm coming into this blind! And given Netflix's track record of butchering animes to live action (yes Cowboy Bebop sucked deal with it). Expectations were fairly low, but the reviews were coming in positive including from reviewers who I would expect to hate it so maybe it's better than I thought?

.........yeah pretty much!

Surprisingly this is actually a solid series. It's clear that they gave the writers/creators more leeway to stay truthful to the show and I know they had the original anime creator's approval as well. Now I don't know any of these characters or what they cut out of the show, but honestly 1000 episodes will drag. I watched 375+ episodes of Fairy Tail and yes I love that series, but it could be shorter than 375 episodes! This feels a lot more condensed and tight and gets on with it. Nothing feels like un-necessary filler. Even the flashbacks for characters are needed, interesting and don't waste my time.

Now the tone is certainly fairly silly in general but then it still doesn't shy away from showing blood, sword slicing and self-harm (apparently on Netflix that's enough to get a 15 rating). This world is certainly pretty crazy and wacky, but then it just opens it up for a lot of cool characters and scenarios. The world building is great with lots of cool settings and the set designs are amazing.

And characters galore! The casting in this is top notch with everyone playing their part perfectly and fitting what I little I know of their anime counterparts. And each one feels defined, unique and in most cases, cool and badass. Zoro is a tri-sword wielding badass. Nami as a bo-staff wielding drop dead adorably gorgeous orange-head thief will forever embrace my dreams for the next 10 years (oh shut up, you think the same also, I love a red head, orange is close enough!) Luffy is infectiouisly endearing with his dream. Sanji as a martial arts cook is cool as well and likable. And many more.........sorta. Koby and Helmeppo are a little annoying at times, but their appearances are pretty brief, but OH GOD SHUT UP USOPP! What is the point of this character? He contributes NOTHING! He achieves NOTHING! He's annoying, keeps trying to take credit, can't do anything right other than shoot straight with a slingshot, WOW! There's zero reason he should be on the ship and I wish he wasn't there.

Action wise, the CGI does what it can for the budget, especially when you're dealing with a rubber man. It looks a bit corny at times, but not too bad, but when it's used, it's doing cool stuff and if you can't make CGI look realistic, make it look cool. On the flip side though the chloreography in this is great. Some impressive sword fights and staff moves. OK it's not ""up there"" levels, but it's decent enough.

I binged through the series in 3 nights and given these episodes are nearly an hour long each, that's giving it good praise. Do I want to check out the anime, no it's 1000 episodes. But do I want to see Season 2 (which just got confirmed)? Hell yea, I'm down for more adventures in this crazy world, especially if the same talent is behind it.

I expected it to be bad. But it's actually really, really good. And remember this is a live action anime. That's no small feat achieved.

What an incredible show,"Had extremely low expectations. Netflix adaptation? How could it even be good. But this shows that they can still make good stuff. Dialogue is solid, jokes aren't cheesy.

That was end of the review, I'm not sure what else to say, but I apparently have to come up with filler. Why do I have to come up with filler? Who came up with such a system? No idea, but it really needs to go. It probably worsens the review system to be this strict.

There's so much to enjoy,"I've been watching/reading One Piece since the Kaizoku-Fansubs days, circa 2001. I'm sure a lot of people in here have as well, and aside from some of the Power Ranger-y fight scenes, I'm absolutely happy with how this turned out.

They really captured the essence of One Piece without trying too hard to make a 1:1 adaptation. In some areas they really thrived, other parts felt a bit lacking, but overall I really hope this gets to keep going and you can really tell Oda had his hand in the creation of this.

Zoro and Buggy absolutely stole the show for me, and somehow Helmeppo and Koby were the closest characters to the anime and I really loved them on screen.

OG fans, don't be too hard on it. Sure it has its cheesy parts but we all expect that. Try to enjoy it for what it is, which is an adaptation--not an exact replica but with real people.

Can't wait to watch it again but with the original Japanese voice actors.",03-Sep-23,10.0,ive watchingreading one piece since kaizokufansubs days circa im sure lot people well aside power rangery fight scenes im absolutely happy turned really captured essence one piece without trying hard make adaptation areas really thrived parts felt bit lacking overall really hope gets keep going really tell oda hand creation zoro buggy absolutely stole show somehow helmeppo koby closest characters anime really loved screen og fans dont hard sure cheesy parts expect try enjoy adaptationnot exact replica real people cant wait watch original japanese voice actors
Just no,"The live action shouldn't be called like that.

The changed important parts of the story that will make viewers see the characters with different perspectives.

Some of the actors are really bad chosed, and the biggest example is Luffy. The actor doesn't have the Luffy vibe. And the child that they put doing young luffy it's nothing alike the original characte.

Another one is Shanks. Where is is charm? Gone.

The hat is really bad done. I have one straw hat home that is more similar to Luffy's, and it wasn't brought on propose.

"Save your time, watch paint dry instead.","I've not seen or heard of the Anime show this was based on so came to this with no expectations but lordy this is amazingly bad. Awful hammy acting, bland lines delivered poorly, and forgettable action scenes with mediocre bog standard choreography.

Mix that with some poor editing and an annoying soundtrack makes this diabolical tripe unwatchable beyond the first episode.

Amazing.,"I'll fully admit, I'm biased. I started ready One Piece 20 years ago. But, I loved this. Fantastic adaptation. For the last 20 years I've been a Zoro stan, but damn, the guy playing Sanji did such a phenomenal job... I'm questioning everything. Just like in the mana Syrup Island drags a little. That's my main complaint. But the casting is incredible. I loved how they integrated Garp, Helmeppo and Koby into the whole season.

"As a long time fan, loved it!","I didn't get my hopes up because of how terrible live-action versions of anime usually are, but they did a great job this time I absolutely loved it and had a great time watching it! The characters and actors were amazing, can't wait for a season 2. There are a few differences from the anime, but nothing too major, and those things carry the show at a quicker pace. Some things might be a little rushed, but for as long as one piece is, it's probably a good thing to go quickly through some of this, as most of the first season is introducing the characters. For someone not familiar with the anime I think it will be a great watch too, and if you're a fan like me who's been watching/reading for a long time then it's a fun experience that brings nostalgia and a fun new twist to the show/manga.",02-Sep-23,10.0,didnt get hopes terrible liveaction versions anime usually great job time absolutely loved great time watching characters actors amazing cant wait season differences anime nothing major things carry show quicker pace things might little rushed long one piece probably good thing go quickly first season introducing characters someone familiar anime think great watch youre fan like whos watchingreading long time fun experience brings nostalgia fun new twist showmanga
The first good Anime adaptation!,"I've been watching One Piece since childhood and the Anime is one of my favourite shows. So naturally, i had my concerns when i heard about the Netflix adaptation. But it's a solid show that does One Piece justice! But, there are some issues and some good stuff:

+Good Luffy!

+Good Zoro!

+Good Usopp!

+Good Garp!

+Good Barati√©!

+Amazing portrayal of Mihawk!

+Good and intense fights!

+Has this unique One Piece atmosphere!

+This electricity everywhere actually is a nice change.

+Denden Mushi headsets? Cool!!

+Good pacing! (The anime is insanely long and this show solved this problem in a good way.)

-Nami should have been played by another actress in my opinion. One Piece girls are skinny!

-Sanji is totally different and i don't mean in a good way! Where's his constant smoking? Where's his perverted nature?

-Going Merry looks totally awful (unnecessary ears and open mouth, wtf?) -Why didn't they show Alvida's devil fruit power??

-Arlong looks weird and isn't as threatening.

-Captain Kuro is way slimmer in the anime!

-Gold Roger looks like a weird geezer and not like the King of Pirates.

-Luffy should be stronger.

-The Syrup Village plot should have been one episode.

-Some of the cinematography is weak.

-Some dialogues are boring.

One missing piece of the live action puzzle,"There has always been an elastic and more tocic relationship between fandom, source material, creators, commercial studios, writers and director. Everyone is pulling and trying to influence as much as possible to have it catered to their needs. But can you blame them? How many (anime/manga) classics have been butchered for the sake of making money. The thing with this show is that the creator is involved and cast grew up with it but also a studio and NF to give that freedom.

I hope this shows to all that serializing wins over a movie content crop cgi fest. Also, creative freedom, good writing, staying more true to the source in visuals without having it look like a carnaval but still add some new feel to it makes it worth the adventure.

For once I'm excited for a second season. More budget is needed. I mean the Zoro actor can really swordplay (Rurouni Kenshin) so make that come out. Supporting cast is great but for a potential S2 and the expected roster of Franky, Chopper, Nico Robin and maybe Brook, a bit of an upgrade in overall CGI would do them great.

One piece live action is.....,"Amazing, Love the Netflix one piece and I'm addiction to the anime. At first I was like everyone not wanting to binge the anime cuz it was long (1,071 episodes at the time) but when I heard about the live action I wasn't sure how it be cuz COWBOY BEBOP was trash and the anime was better. So I decided to watch the anime first fell in love and is my new obsession. Within a month I wad around ep 700 the dress rossa arc. When the live action came out I saw it in one sitting, it's 85% accurate to the anime with things added & removed which is fine cuz some parts were not needed cuz of fillers, or other character had minor roles but those who saw the anime and watches this anime could fit the missing pieces, But without any spoilers, you'll love the live action, it's fun, close to the anime by 80%, love the story, characters and everything about the live action

If a season 2 doesn't come out soon, or you just wanna continue where the live action ends you could start on ep48 Which would introduce smoker and the loguetown arc and so on....and trust me you'll love the anime it gets better.

Case you wanna see the live action recap in anime form you can watch ONE PIECE EPISODE EAST BLUE, which is the movie about 1hr long where its the first 47 episodes of the anime and 8 episodes of the live action but you'll also see some other part that you didn't see in the live action as well as e aster eggs and hidden things that true one piece fans will love and appreciate.",14-Sep-23,10.0,amazing love netflix one piece im addiction anime first like everyone wanting binge anime cuz long episodes time heard live action wasnt sure cuz cowboy bebop trash anime better decided watch anime first fell love new obsession within month wad around ep dress rossa arc live action came saw one sitting accurate anime things added removed fine cuz parts needed cuz fillers character minor roles saw anime watches anime could fit missing pieces without spoilers youll love live action fun close anime love story characters everything live action season doesnt come soon wanna continue live action ends could start ep would introduce smoker loguetown arc onand trust youll love anime gets better case wanna see live action recap anime form watch one piece episode east blue movie hr long first episodes anime episodes live action youll also see part didnt see live action well e aster eggs hidden things true one piece fans love appreciate
I'm not sure about rating yet!,"I like the characters so far except Sanji's hair If you cut Usopp's nose out you should give a better haircut to Sanji, because he is a handsome guy but the haircut.

This is looks like a PLAY, not a tv show, the light the camera - not good mate not good

I'm not sure if someone can understand the whole picture from this half-a** product if they never read the manga or watch the anime, but still it's fun to watch

I think each episode of this series should be like one of the Avengers movies at least (in every aspects).

But from what I watched it looks like this is a test run and it gonna shuts down soon and real one starts.

And if it isn't a test run that means the people who making this show didn't watched or read the OnePiece, and please someone notifies Oda!

I've got so much emotion from black and white pictures on manga from more than 20 years ago, but this one, I can't put my hand on it but it doesn't fill right, as I mentioned before I like the actors but they can't act properly if the director isn't good enough to guide them.

THE BEST anime adaptation so far,"First of all, I've never watched OP because of its episodes barrier. But I do watch anime. So I didn't have high hopes for this one, because we saw so many LA fail so many times. But bro... glad I gave it a shot and it's soooooo worth it.

I think in the end it comes down to the plot in LA rather than fights and visual esthetics (cuz you can't do some things on LA which anime does without making it look odd).

On a second thought.. I vote 10,"Absolutely amazing. The cast the storytelling, music. Everything in this show is perfect. I canceled my Netflix subscription 2 years ago because of the low quality, lgbt and anti-family propagandistic movies but with this,,, I think after watching this show, I am gonna reactivate my subscription ASAP. It makes you feel good positive. It gave me the feeling of a pirate of the caribbean but much much HAPPY and a perfect background. I love the colors.

"Not Nearly As Good As the Original, Story and Script Wise","The live action adaptation of One Piece has become utterly shallow in basic writing and narrative. Important details are missing yet other important details exist making it feel incomplete and riddled with errors. This also results in either less impactful or climactic moments in the series, or just entirely removing those moments to begin with. It feels less contrived and planned and more simplistic with little to no effort into making it even remotely complex. Even with however simplistic and seemingly one-dimensional the East Blue saga always was, it was always somewhat of a subtle masterpiece and assuredly was never this lacking in these areas..an abomination would be an understatement. A good metaphorical description of it is: Hollywood's representation and exploration of One Piece's surface-level clich√© of overdramatizing the themes of adventure and ""chasing your dreams"".

Fire.,"An absolutely perfect (well, not so perfect adaptation of the manga) but a perfect live action movie of an anime/manga. It was amazing and i love the acting and how great it was with the different stories in the same episodes, Koby and Garp along with Luffy and the rest of the crew was amazing! They did all of the backstories very well and made them look amazing, they added more depth too which was amazing to see. I loved this adaptation and have been a fan of One Piece for quite a long time, this is the greatest live action movie i have ever watched. (Of an anime of course there are marvel movies too) but i only had one issue and that was with how much they switched up the story though, i would have wanted to see it from straight up chapter 1 to the finishing of arlong park but the story was changed quite much throughout the live action. For example, Arlong at baratie? But i loved Mihawk and Garp's exchange, it put more contrast to the warlords in my opinion and made me actually take in and realize how big of an authority they have in the world of one piece. 10/10.",31-Aug-23,10.0,absolutely perfect well perfect adaptation manga perfect live action movie animemanga amazing love acting great different stories episodes koby garp along luffy rest crew amazing backstories well made look amazing added depth amazing see loved adaptation fan one piece quite long time greatest live action movie ever watched anime course marvel movies one issue much switched story though would wanted see straight chapter finishing arlong park story changed quite much throughout live action example arlong baratie loved mihawk garps exchange put contrast warlords opinion made actually take realize big authority world one piece

One Piece Live Action is a Remarkable Adaptation that Surpasses Expectations,"One Piece Live Action a Remarkable Adaptation that Surpasses Expectations

One Piece, known for its immense popularity as an anime, has finally ventured into the realm of live-action adaptations. Skepticism and concern often surround such endeavors, as many anime-to-live-action transitions have fallen short. However, to my pleasant surprise, the One Piece live-action series defies the odds and delivers an exceptional viewing experience. From its captivating fights to its outstanding cinematography and remarkable portrayal of beloved characters, this adaptation proves to be a triumph on multiple levels.

One of the initial concerns I had was how the show would handle the intense and extravagant fights that are synonymous with the anime. Thankfully, the creators of the live-action series have managed to overcome this challenge brilliantly. The fight sequences are well-choreographed, visually stunning, and keep viewers on the edge of their seats. The attention to detail in capturing the essence of the original battles is commendable, resulting in engaging and thrilling action that truly does justice to the source material.

The cinematography in the One Piece live-action series is undeniably remarkable. The production team has gone above and beyond, creating visually stunning scenes that transport viewers into the vibrant and adventurous world of the One Piece universe. Each frame is carefully crafted, showcasing breathtaking landscapes, intricate set designs, and mesmerizing visual effects. The result is a visually immersive experience that adds a new dimension to the beloved story.

One of the most crucial aspects of any adaptation is how well the characters are portrayed, and the One Piece live-action series does not disappoint. The actors bring the beloved characters to life with authenticity and dedication, staying true to their unique personalities and mannerisms. From the charismatic Monkey D. Luffy to the enigmatic Roronoa Zoro and the endearing Nami, each character feels like a faithful interpretation of their anime counterparts. The performances are compelling, capturing the essence of these beloved characters and creating a genuine connection with the audience.

The One Piece live-action series is a resounding success that surpasses expectations and sets a new standard for anime adaptations. From the captivating fight sequences to the exceptional cinematography and outstanding character portrayals, every aspect of this adaptation has been meticulously crafted. It not only does justice to the source material but also stands on its own as a remarkable television series.

Absolutely amazing,"Having read the manga, I can definitely say this was an amazing adaptation! All the characters have been perfectly casted (especially Luffy and Mihawk) and the dialogue is engaging as well. The attention to detail and the sets, costumes, cgi are top notch. Hope to see this continue in the upcoming seasons. Its a perfect weekend watch that I highly recommend for people looking for a lighthearted adventure.

One Piece is FINALLY good,"Everyone knows One Piece. As a child or teenager, you sat in front of the TV after school and watched One Piece. The series could captivate you with its interesting world and the varied forces of the opponents and fellow combatants and was filled with beautiful moments that uphold friendship and camaraderie, that praise the helpfulness and friendliness.

Today, the series is still popular with many anime fans, although it probably has just as many rejecters and haters. For me personally, the show with increasing age and maturity, as well as from the anime increasingly disparaging attitude to women, unfortunately became unwatchable. I don't find it funny when a man dies of blood loss from an erection, because only a woman just greeted him. I don't find it funny when men simply grab or fall on women's breasts against their will. They should either get together, make love on the spot, or make it clear that there is no interest and stop this behavior. This childish ""hihi breasts"" is simply ridiculous for the now older audience from the past.

But now that we have the live action adaptation, we finally have a version of One Piece where 50% of the scenes don't make you feel ashamed when someone enters the room, be it, for example, a little man standing between the gigantic breasts of two completely physically identical women, while the adult women act like 4 year old toddlers and realize for the first time in their lives that they have breasts.

This live action adaptation from Netflix is faithful to the original, compact, has a great cast and crew, has a lot of humor and yet is simply more adult and clearly aimed at viewers who no longer want to put up with the vile misogynistic fan service in the anime. For me, clearly the best version of One Piece and has my recommendation for all adults who watched the show in their childhood and youth and want to relive it without having to endure the degradation of women.",31-Aug-23,9.0,everyone knows one piece child teenager sat front tv school watched one piece series could captivate interesting world varied forces opponents fellow combatants filled beautiful moments uphold friendship camaraderie praise helpfulness friendliness today series still popular many anime fans although probably many rejecters haters personally show increasing age maturity well anime increasingly disparaging attitude women unfortunately became unwatchable dont find funny man dies blood loss erection woman greeted dont find funny men simply grab fall womens breasts either get together make love spot make clear interest stop behavior childish hihi breasts simply ridiculous older audience past live action adaptation finally version one piece scenes dont make feel ashamed someone enters room example little man standing gigantic breasts two completely physically identical women adult women act like year old toddlers realize first time lives breasts live action adaptation netflix faithful original compact great cast crew lot humor yet simply adult clearly aimed viewers longer want put vile misogynistic fan service anime clearly best version one piece recommendation adults watched show childhood youth want relive without endure degradation women
This is a Hit! Let's go Season 2!,"A good series with already a confirmed Season 2 on its end.

When it comes to live action series adapting anime to either the small or big screen, it's gonna be a hit or miss. Hit such as Samurai X, Detective Pikachu and a very, very MISS, awful adaptations like Dragon Ball Evolution and The Last Airbender. But One Piece here is undoubtedly a hit!

This 8 episode series opener provides enough back story to each of the main protagonists throughout all the episodes. It captures some of the great, memorable moments from the anime. Although there are things that are quite obviously changed in the live action, Season 1 shows a great potential that this series may last long - just don't decline on quality.

The pacing is good (as evident to my last remark), the protagonists where well performed, the cinematography could be better and the music is good. Anticipating to see Franky, Chopper and Robin in the next season. So if you are a fan of the anime, if you enjoy binge watching quality series or you just want to watch a random show, you'll enjoy One Piece!

Emily Rudd and Mackenyu Arata are my absolute favorites!

I am really surprised! üòä,"This show is so cool! I loved it!

Really good actors! First time that i nearly like all actors from a Netflix Show.

The Sets and costumes are amazing and i love the Details.

And also the Music - often its really nice to hear it and the Music in the last Szene is great!

The Story is fun and i never thought that i would like such a kind of Show.

The Finale of the season is really really good. The last two Episodes are full of Action and the end is really cute and made me smile.

Pleasantly Surprised,"After the absolute disaster that was Netflix's Cowboy Bebop, I had a lot of reservations going into their attempt at bringing One Piece to the live action format. I started to hear quite a bit of positive buzz around the show, however, so my interest was eventually piqued. After watching the series, I have to give Netflix credit for finally faithfully adapting an anime. I really enjoyed One Piece. It's not perfect but the production value is high (other than a few moments of questionable CGI), the writing is good, and the show is just plain entertaining. The shot composition and combat scenes are also excellent. Netflix's Bebop was full of flat shots which lost all of the magic and style of the original but most of that seems to be remedied by the show runners here. Most importantly, it is made with respect to the source material. Characters are not rewritten ""for a western audience"" and major plot points are not disregarded or changed because the writers think they know better than the original creator of the source material. I'd almost say I want Netflix to give Bebop another try.",08-Sep-23,8.0,absolute disaster netflixs cowboy bebop lot reservations going attempt bringing one piece live action format started hear quite bit positive buzz around show however interest eventually piqued watching series give netflix credit finally faithfully adapting anime really enjoyed one piece perfect production value high moments questionable cgi writing good show plain entertaining shot composition combat scenes also excellent netflixs bebop full flat shots lost magic style original seems remedied show runners importantly made respect source material characters rewritten western audience major plot points disregarded changed writers think know better original creator source material id almost say want netflix give bebop another try
Close to the original,"The effects are really well made.

The same voice synchronisation(de) as in the anime.

They stick to the story more or less(see below).

The characters look close to the fictionals.

The audience shifted to a more mature audience in comparison to the anime and it was really well done.

There are only small points which bothered me:

1. Captain Rodgers speach before he dies. (I don't know if it was hyped in other languages as well but in german everybody knows this quote:""Ihr wollt meinen Schatz? Den k√∂nnt ihr haben, sucht in doch! Irgendwo hab ich den gr√∂√üten Schatz der Welt versteckt!"") This point was just a missed oppertunity.

But it was sad not to see other key figures at this point (Buggy, Don Quichotte de Flamingo, Monkey D. Dragon).

2. Zorro, Nami and Ruffie would meet under different occasions but to keep the pace up it was okay and quite well written. (Season 1 ends with Anime episode 45/1074.)

3. Arlongs Arc would be much longer. Zorros fight angainst Okta(also a main sidecharacter) was completly skipped.

4. Buggy shouldn't appear in Arlong Arc, small Buggy should Team up with Alabaster-Alvida instead and than aquire his bodyparts back.

I know it's hard to put 45 episodes √° 20min, total of 15h into 8h.

I'm currios how they would progress the next seasons.

(So I think next season will progress something like this: 2-3ep grandline chopper; 3-4ep alabasta robin. And from this point onward I think the pace will increase drastically something like big arcs e.g.: skypia will get 1-2ep)",07-Sep-23,9.0,effects really well made voice synchronisationde anime stick story lesssee characters look close fictionals audience shifted mature audience comparison anime really well done small points bothered captain rodgers speach dies dont know hyped languages well german everybody knows quoteihr wollt meinen schatz den knnt ihr haben sucht doch irgendwo hab ich den grten schatz der welt versteckt point missed oppertunity sad see key figures point buggy quichotte de flamingo monkey dragon zorro nami ruffie would meet different occasions keep pace okay quite well written season ends anime episode arlongs arc would much longer zorros fight angainst oktaalso main sidecharacter completly skipped buggy shouldnt appear arlong arc small buggy team alabasteralvida instead aquire bodyparts back know hard put episodes min total h h im currios would progress next seasons think next season progress something like ep grandline chopper ep alabasta robin point onward think pace increase drastically something like big arcs eg skypia get ep
"It does not capture the 1,000+ Anime version","This live adaptation of One Piece does not capture the essence of the manga nor is it as fun to watch as the 1,000+ episodes and multiple movies. The live action Luffy character misses the mark entirely. He does not have the childhood wonder of the anime version. Each new discovery about himself does not have the anime ""oh cool"" attitude but rather is more one of arrogance. The other main characters also miss the mark. The casting seems to be more about diversity than acting ability. I expected changes in how the Luffy story was handled but it is confusing at best. Did the writers and director even watch the anime through the first 100 or so episodes? Any attempt to craft a series based on what has made One Piece so popular for 20 years?

Sorry, I watched the first episode and about half of the second before I gave up.

Where's the One Piece we know and love,"Not a bad try, but where are all the moments that make One Piece, well, One Piece. The Live action is too fast-paced, you dont get 95% of the moments that made you fall in love with the crew in the first place. Almost none of the moment that made you feel like Luffy really was a special kind of person in the anime/manga are present here. Mostly looks like a brat who is chasing food along the world without much purpose. What i'm trying to say is that I can't seem to be able to love Luffy as much as I wish I could considering what the series is giving me. Major disapointement.

I'll stick with the anime,"Coming from a One Piece fan I was extremely nervous when this show was going to come out. I had high expectations because this has been a journey I've loved watching. Unfortunately, the things that made the anime so great and exciting were missing from this adaptation. I'll be honest if the title ""One Piece"" wasn't on this show, I would have gave up on it after episode two.

There is an episode on Avatar the last air bender season 3 when the main characters go see a play of themselves and outside of Toph and the crowd, they were devastated. That's the best way I can explain how I felt after watching this. So much creative freedom was taken by the company that they just made entire episodes and plot lines that weren't even in the source material. But hey that's Hollywood.

Better than expected.,"I was looking was a reason to start the One Piece anime and the series was the trigger point.

It covers the East Blue Saga except Lougetown Arc.

Watched all anime arcs with their respective episodes side by side & compared & would say that it's quite a loyal adaptation. There are few minor changes but doesn't deviate from the storyline. Although there are many changes in the Arlong Park which was a little bit disappointing.

The casting was perfect. Watched some interviews of the cast, they are perfect for their role. Although the acting of some of the characters felt a little bit off.

But overall Season 1 was awesome.

Great adaptation!,"One Piece somehow managed to pull it off: a legit great live-action anime. It does a great job adapting the first East Blue saga (first 95 manga chapters and 45 anime episodes), condensed down to eight hour-long episodes. It's mostly faithful to the source material, but condenses down some stuff and makes some changes for a live-action format.

For One Piece fans, it's a great way to revisit the early East Blue saga. I watched the anime version of that saga almost 20 years ago, so it felt fresh watching a live-action version after all this time. The story beats and character development have been mostly preserved, with some foreshadowing added, and the fights are very well-choreographed.

The original Japanese anime is a 10/10 show for me. The live-action does fall short of the anime in some ways, but it's as close as it gets. At the very least, the live action is far better than the terrible 4Kids anime dub.",08-Sep-23,,one piece somehow managed pull legit great liveaction anime great job adapting first east blue saga first manga chapters anime episodes condensed eight hourlong episodes mostly faithful source material condenses stuff makes changes liveaction format one piece fans great way revisit early east blue saga watched anime version saga almost years ago felt fresh watching liveaction version time story beats character development mostly preserved foreshadowing added fights wellchoreographed original japanese anime show liveaction fall short anime ways close gets least live action far better terrible kids anime dub
"Great adaption, not sure it could be better really","There's always going to be whingers, moaners and complainers. It's natural for people when they see something which isn't what they originally saw. These people will never be satisfied because unless their mind was wiped and they saw the show again, they will continue to be pessimistic and call out all the things that are different from the original show. Well these people need a wake up call, because anything that is adapted from something else isn't going to be the same show, that's kinda the point. This show as someone who has seen One Piece is great. It's not easy trying to recreate anime in live action format with real people. The dialogue is astounding, the graphics and animations resemble the show well and the casting has been mostly on point.

Very very good,"I thought it would turn out average, but netflix surprised me. I didn't like that because of a slightly different plot, many important character traits of many heroes were not revealed, but I think Oda is not a fool and he just understood that this is the only way to shorten the timing. The new plotline is even more exciting and will be interesting to those who watched, because the plot follows a different line, but globally everything is like in anime.

I was also initially confused by the cast of heroes, but they look very good on the screen and it feels like I'm watching anime. This series will obviously be taken as an example when they talk about new netflix adaptations. Eichiro Oda is a genius.

It will be different that's a fact it's about what I expected of the characters and how they would be in a live version there obviously not going to be as 'animated' as the anime obviously but I feel they have grasped the essence of each character and adapted it to how that personality would show in real life.

To me, this is the most wonderful and magnificient cinematic experience so far this year (and for TV series of all time, just after Stranger Things).

Astonishing,"This show is a riot all by itself.

Over and above that, I can't imagine a better job being done on the conversion from anime to live action.

If I can think hard to find a minus in this show ,It will be the actress who portaited Nami.

She isnt itm They could find someone else much more suitable but who knows maybe She ll grow and somehow get better in season two.

What else do you want from a show?

Loving it so far,"3 episodes deep and loving everything so far.

Each character has depth, and the actors are doing a perfect job.

Some of the story changes are great. Spreading Luffys flashback out over the episodes and it all ties together nicely.

The music is fine, I've not heard enough to say it's memorable.

The fight scenes in the first episode are fantastic, the cinematography seems beautiful so far.

Most the of sets are amazing, they all play the part well. But feels very small set to small set. Nothing that's been massive, but I understand the live action cant be the anime.

Definitely the Best of its Genre.,"The script is well written and keeps really well with the source material. The actors did a great job giving the characters depth and flair. The sets and filming were beautiful, realistic, and fun. It kept with fantasy, whimsy and seriousness of the source without going to far one way or the other, which had been the problem with most in this genre. They are either too comical or too serious. One Piece was done with near perfect symmetry. It definitely deserves at least two more seasons if not more. It has a great start and builds with each episode.

"Wow, love it!","As an early fan of the manga (end of 90's), I was looking forward with curiosity (and a bit of worry) to this live-action release. TBH, I'm really happy with tis first season. Of course having the author (Oda) supervising probably helped a lot. The casting is amazing! I was a bit worried with some people complaining about Usopp being subpar but he's OK: filthy liar, braggard and coward as he was supposed to be. I just don't get why they gave him a greek nose instead of his Pinocchio one. Well, less work for the props I guess. Zef, Buggy, Mihawk, Shanks, Kaya... even Helmeppo are all amazing. I don't know why Nojiko suddenly turned black but... OK, the actress is up to the role.

The cast of characters was almost perfect with a few exceptions here and there. The CGI was not bad at all as I was worried it would be rough around the edges.

The script appears to have been written by someone who may not be familiar with One Piece,"The script appears to have been written by someone who may not be familiar with One Piece or might have relied solely on the English Dub version. The dialogues lack authenticity and fail to capture the essence of each character's personality. The absence of emotional moments, such as when Roger discusses finding the One Piece, is noticeable. The motivations behind Luffy's desire to become a pirate are unclear, and the portrayal of Alvida as a menacing pirate falls short. Additionally, the inclusion of Zoro within Baroque Works doesn't align with the original storyline's timeline.

While it's understandable that condensing the story into 8 episodes is challenging, the script's execution leaves much to be desired. The film's direction lacks clarity, vacillating between a dark and goofy tone akin to Western pirate movies or a faithful shounen adventure. This inconsistency detracts from the overall experience. Moreover, the injection of anime/manga catchphrases into a series that maintains a serious atmosphere comes across as cringe-worthy.

A more effective approach could be emulating the successful adaptation of Pirates of the Caribbean, either by faithfully recreating characters and stories or by undertaking comprehensive character and story adaptations while maintaining their original essence. The current execution appears subpar, echoing the issues faced by other live-action anime series.",31-Aug-23,3.0,script appears written someone may familiar one piece might relied solely english dub version dialogues lack authenticity fail capture essence characters personality absence emotional moments roger discusses finding one piece noticeable motivations behind luffys desire become pirate unclear portrayal alvida menacing pirate falls short additionally inclusion zoro within baroque works doesnt align original storylines timeline understandable condensing story episodes challenging scripts execution leaves much desired films direction lacks clarity vacillating dark goofy tone akin western pirate movies faithful shounen adventure inconsistency detracts overall experience moreover injection animemanga catchphrases series maintains serious atmosphere comes across cringeworthy effective approach could emulating successful adaptation pirates caribbean either faithfully recreating characters stories undertaking comprehensive character story adaptations maintaining original essence current execution appears subpar echoing issues faced liveaction anime series
"Incredible achievement, great TV","That was a hell of a ride from the pre production to here. This project was always looking good from the casting, to the showrunners being legit fans and Eiichiro Oda's involvement, but even with all the good indications i didnt expect it would be THAT good.

The success of this show is managing to cast and then introduce to the audience five charming and loveable people that play the main cast. Especially finding a Luffy was an extremely hard task and they nailed it, same goes for the others.

Now we a have a beautiful crew to follow for the seasons to come, you wanna know them, you wanna see them interract, you wanna see them reach closer and closer to their goals.

Netflix did a netflix again,"Well, it definitely was supposed to be the king of all shows. All the multi million dollar budget and oda san having a role in the production was all great hype. But in the end it's just disappointing and borderline infuriating.

The straw hats were all pretty good in their roles. But then again, luffy felt so restricted. He's just not the goofball we know. And the kid luffy is just a whiny kid and it just s*cked.

Buggy was awesome. Definitely the best part of the series. So was hawkeye. Alvida just wasn't terrifying. The decision to include garp was just stupid. Typical netflix move.

The thing they messed up the most was the reason for each character to join luffy. They changed zoros intro so much that they forgot there was a ""not a crue"" gag going on after 2 episodes. They made Usopp the pointless dummy in his own arc. And Sanji? He just straight up says the choreboy asked me, so im gonna join. Took out the whole essence of his character.

The direction and camera work seems worldclass in some places and in others, it looks like it's made by a 3 year old in an i phone. All the shots where they are almost shoving the camera into the actors mouth looks like b grade material. The colour grading mostly is bad. So is the music.

Looks like a season 2 is on the cards, so please fire the director and writers and hire someone competent, someone who loves the orginal. No one would kind if you make small changes. But if you insist on making such huge changes, you are not the one who should be the captain.",04-Sep-23,5.0,well definitely supposed king shows multi million dollar budget oda san role production great hype end disappointing borderline infuriating straw hats pretty good roles luffy felt restricted hes goofball know kid luffy whiny kid scked buggy awesome definitely best part series hawkeye alvida wasnt terrifying decision include garp stupid typical netflix move thing messed reason character join luffy changed zoros intro much forgot crue gag going episodes made usopp pointless dummy arc sanji straight says choreboy asked im gonna join took whole essence character direction camera work seems worldclass places others looks like made year old phone shots almost shoving camera actors mouth looks like b grade material colour grading mostly bad music looks like season cards please fire director writers hire someone competent someone loves orginal one would kind make small changes insist making huge changes one captain

Wonderful world of One Piece,"I started watching One Piece anime when it first started becoming available, which was a long time ago. Since its first episode, I was instantly a fan, and would say it is probably my favourite anime of all time.

While I have been nit-picky with other anime live-actions (Rurouni Kenshin, Death Note, Cowboy Bebop, etc.), I actually enjoyed them for what they were, despite knowing they weren't completely faithful to the original. No doubt, I also had my gripes watching OPLA, such as casting and portrayal of some beloved characters, (SPOILER AHEAD) omitting Loguetown before the cast-off ceremony, story changes, and some other trivialities not worth mentioning.

On the positive, I feel that the majority of the casting and character portrayals were done surprisingly well, which is no small feat considering how out of the world and bizarre the magnificent world of One Piece is (bringing cartoony fiction to live-action is never easy). I also feel that the changes to the live-action story are necessary, as it is too hard to squish roughly 50 anime episodes (approx. 20 mins each) of story to 8 one hour episodes without alteration. I would say some of the story changes were actually an improvement for the purpose of a live-action interpretation.

In a nutshell, OPLA captures the spirit of the original. You do not need to have read the manga or watched the anime to follow the story. For me, it was an extremely fun and adventurous ride with a lot of heart. Watching One Piece is like experiencing exciting new things for the first time. By the end, you can't help but feel a healthy dose of childhood nostalgia.",04-Sep-23,10.0,started watching one piece anime first started becoming available long time ago since first episode instantly fan would say probably favourite anime time nitpicky anime liveactions rurouni kenshin death note cowboy bebop etc actually enjoyed despite knowing werent completely faithful original doubt also gripes watching opla casting portrayal beloved characters spoiler ahead omitting loguetown castoff ceremony story changes trivialities worth mentioning positive feel majority casting character portrayals done surprisingly well small feat considering world bizarre magnificent world one piece bringing cartoony fiction liveaction never easy also feel changes liveaction story necessary hard squish roughly anime episodes approx mins story one hour episodes without alteration would say story changes actually improvement purpose liveaction interpretation nutshell opla captures spirit original need read manga watched anime follow story extremely fun adventurous ride lot heart watching one piece like experiencing exciting new things first time end cant help feel healthy dose childhood nostalgia

I will dare to say that this is the best live action remake that I've ever seen. If I could have bought the series, I would have.

This is everything I hoped for,"I've been following this adaptation since it was first announced back in 2017, and have been an active member of the community of fans who were anxiously waiting for it daily since 2020.

I have discussed, speculated and talked about literally everything there is to be talked about. I had criticisms, concerns, hopes, worries...

But after watching it, all those worries simply washed away. I was fully immersed in this ""new"" world and did not notice time go by.

It's been half a day since I finished bingeing the series and I still cannot think of a single thing I disliked.

I understand this is it's own thing, that its not a copy and paste of the source material, and I'm here for it. All the changes made sense to me and I enjoyed this new (but old) journey!

Firstly Kobe- bargain store Harry Potter, always sniveling and apologetic and scared of his own shadow, terrible character.

Secondly,Monkey D. Luffy, his ""WOHOOOOOOS"" and punching the air get old real quick.

These two really lowered the tone for me, the performance of these actors somehow walk the line between wooden and ham acting.

Other than that, the rest of the show was great, some of the other characters are really likable although I did feel the last few episodes of the series dragged on a bit.

An adaptation worthy of the legacy,"I've been reading One Piece since it was first published as a manga, yes I'm that old, needless to say I'm a pretty big fan, and it has a special place in my heart since its the last remaining on-going titles from the golden age of manga.

The west has failed badly at manga adaptations for decades now, from Dragon Ball to Cowboy Bebop, all nothing more than a cash grab without a soul, aiming to milk whatever they could from the fans, and I'm glad they all failed hard. Naturally I was very skeptical when I heard Netflix is making live action of One Piece, never expected it to be anything good and only decided to watched ep1 to give it a try.

Boy I was pleasantly surprised, not saying the show is perfect, there are a lot of areas that could've been better, like CGI, some of the fight scenes, props etc. But overall it was a worthy adaptation of the One Piece legacy. Sure the plotline did not follow exactly like the manga, but the writers kept all the essence of the original story intact, which is very rare these days with Hollywood adaptations, think Rings of Power or Wheel of Time. Compare to those soulless work, this show really captured the essence of the story as well as each character, ultimately One Piece is about a bunch of misfits chasing seemingly impossible dreams, and on its way discovers true friendships, the show delivers exactly that, and for that I recommend this show to any fans of the original manga as well as anyone new willing to give this IP a try.",01-Sep-23,8.0,ive reading one piece since first published manga yes im old needless say im pretty big fan special place heart since last remaining ongoing titles golden age manga west failed badly manga adaptations decades dragon ball cowboy bebop nothing cash grab without soul aiming milk whatever could fans im glad failed hard naturally skeptical heard netflix making live action one piece never expected anything good decided watched ep give try boy pleasantly surprised saying show perfect lot areas couldve better like cgi fight scenes props etc overall worthy adaptation one piece legacy sure plotline follow exactly like manga writers kept essence original story intact rare days hollywood adaptations think rings power wheel time compare soulless work show really captured essence story well character ultimately one piece bunch misfits chasing seemingly impossible dreams way discovers true friendships show delivers exactly recommend show fans original manga well anyone new willing give ip try

Fantastic,"This is my first review of anything on IMDB and I do this because alot of Live Actions have failed to capture the feel of the original manga/anime, however, this is the first one I've seen that has been more true than not to the original, sure some things are different or missing, but it does not take away from the first arcs, rather it gives it a nice and comfortable pace that is very fitting for live action, the anime and manga does tend to drag things out way to much. It is truely fantastic and I hope they stick to being true to the story and go beyond.

This truely needs another 6 season. Holyshit it's soooo good. The cast so far has been on point, tho talking about points, I would have like it if Usopp and and Yasopp had that pointy nose ;D, same goes for Sanji's swirlbrow being gone. However, I am not disappointed that they don't have these things. I feel like the cast does justice to their character. I was a bit worried when I saw the trailer, but I was converted in the first episode. Truely the best thing Ive seen in alot of years.

I√±aki Godoy may not look alot like Luffy, but he truely embody Luffys mannerisms and his playfulness.

Emily Rudd does a fantastic Nami, I never really enjoyed Nami, however Rudd brings out another level to Nami and I now enjoy the character. Also very close to how Id imagine Nami as a live version.

Mackenyu and Taz, do their utmost to portray their characters and they feel very believable.

Rest of the cast is perfect, they did a massive and fantastic job in hiring the people for this, everyone fit their roll. Not a single time did I think ""Oh this person does not fit this roll"" and I usually do. I honestly cant wait for a second season, or should I say, more arcs? If they can keep this level up or go beyond, it will be wilder than anything we've seen before, in regards of a live adaptation of a manga/anime.

Perfection,"The live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" is a dazzling triumph that faithfully brings the beloved manga and anime series to life on the big screen. Clocking in at an impressive 600 letters, this review can only scratch the surface of its brilliance.

First and foremost, the casting is impeccable. From Monkey D. Luffy, brilliantly portrayed by a charismatic actor who embodies the character's goofy yet determined spirit, to Roronoa Zoro, whose swordsmanship is both fierce and awe-inspiring, every character feels true to their manga counterparts. The diverse ensemble cast captures the essence of camaraderie that has made the Straw Hat Pirates so endearing.

The production design deserves praise as well. The world of ""One Piece"" is brought to life with breathtaking attention to detail. The vibrant colors and fantastical landscapes are a visual treat. The costumes, especially Luffy's iconic straw hat and Zoro's three swords, are spot-on. And let's not forget the intricate Devil Fruit abilities, which are rendered with astonishing visual effects.

The story faithfully adapts key arcs from the manga, and while some creative liberties are taken to fit the medium, they enhance the overall narrative. The pacing is brisk, ensuring that both fans and newcomers will be enthralled from start to finish. The balance between humor, heart, and high-stakes action is masterfully maintained.

Speaking of action, the choreography in this live-action adaptation is nothing short of spectacular.

The perfect show,"It is more than that of what i thougt would be.. never imagined that Live Action could be this good. I watched all 8 episodes and I am so happy with all the works they have put on to it . Very very good luck and best wishes.

I thought it is going to disappoint us like the other live action but i was so surprised with all the graphics, vfx. It is so so good.

It surely will set a record on Netflix and also the Non OnePiece fan will love it . No one can hate this Live Action MUST WATCH .

A well produced live action adaptation,"I will agree that this starts off a little bit corny and seems like a typical anime live action adaptation. After episode 3 I was completely hooked. They've done a great job changing some lines and dialogue to be more enjoyable in English but the acting was a bit shaky at times. The camera angles were a little annoying at first but then I grew to enjoy it. Great casting overall though. I feel like other anime adaptations can turn out this good too if they had a budget like this. Not saying it's only good because the budget was bigger but definitely a factor. One piece is my favorite anime of all time and I believe they did a great job. Fantastic fight choreography, especially with the zoro fights. Some of the side characters had some fantastic acting as well like Kaya. I enjoyed the casting of the straw hat crew especially nami as well. The sets were marvelous and beautiful. I believe that for people who have not watched this anime, they should at-least watch this and see if this will make them now start watching it. I also believe people who do not even watch anime will enjoy this show as well.",01-Sep-23,9.0,agree starts little bit corny seems like typical anime live action adaptation episode completely hooked theyve done great job changing lines dialogue enjoyable english acting bit shaky times camera angles little annoying first grew enjoy great casting overall though feel like anime adaptations turn good budget like saying good budget bigger definitely factor one piece favorite anime time believe great job fantastic fight choreography especially zoro fights side characters fantastic acting well like kaya enjoyed casting straw hat crew especially nami well sets marvelous beautiful believe people watched anime atleast watch see make start watching also believe people even watch anime enjoy show well
GORGEOUS,"What a beautiful piece of television!

I've seen some anime in the past but I'd never come across One Piece.

I absolutely adore this story. Beautiful sets, heart warming, exciting characters and a total ride from start to finish. I couldn't put it down.

It's been shot amazingly. A vibrant, rich, beautiful world to fall into, the cast is amazing. You can see everyone really loved making this show. That sort of thing just comes through on the screen.

ONE WORD #AWESOME,"For a adaption of manga and anime its very good and I like the way they make a little different approach for us who already watched one piece twice in manga anime so it makes a new taste for us also but they did not forget to add OG scene

GOOD PART. Action scene are very good. The world building is also good for 1st season you can already see how much big uts going. They also make a lot of hype for season 2 to the new audience by giving hint of all warlord one piece zoro dream all blue etc. Vfx is on point everywhere you can not see it inconsistent anywhere. Coutumes are also good.

BAD PART. Fight in ussop village can be a little more extended. Did not like the thing they did not show full Island due to mybe budget.

"Good, but there are some changes I don't understand","First I want to say that this adaptation was ver good. Like really really good. I watched/read the first 100 chapters like 2394823 times but I still enjoyed the every second of it. That being said, I can't understand the changes with Garp. The Baratie part of the story was handled so well with the changes and stuff, same for kurahadol but I just can't understand why they changed the stuff with garp. The grandpa/grandson reveal was one of the best reveals after a long and exhausting arc (and a legendary one) but they just revealed it like nothing. And garp seems much more serious here than manga. I thought that maybe they do this because they aren't planning to make a second season but also we have some important name drops and literally the smoker in the end. Why can't they wait for the Garp reveal. IMO the long waits for big reveals like garp being grandpa is what makes One Piece good. I know that this is series and they have only 8 episodes per season but again, revealing Garp thing that early altered the events and it was just weird. I'm not saying that the early garp reveal was bad, I'm just saying that I can't understand why they did that. Other than that, everything was very good. Especially OST's and casting/actors.",02-Sep-23,8.0,first want say adaptation ver good like really really good watchedread first chapters like times still enjoyed every second said cant understand changes garp baratie part story handled well changes stuff kurahadol cant understand changed stuff garp grandpagrandson reveal one best reveals long exhausting arc legendary one revealed like nothing garp seems much serious manga thought maybe arent planning make second season also important name drops literally smoker end cant wait garp reveal imo long waits big reveals like garp grandpa makes one piece good know series episodes per season revealing garp thing early altered events weird im saying early garp reveal bad im saying cant understand everything good especially osts castingactors
The best live-action anime adaptation to date.,"I think everyone was skeptical at the announcement of a live action one piece. Most of us expected it to fall in the same way as Dragon Ball, Death Note and Cowboy Bepop. However, with oversight from Oda, quality prevailed.

What is most impressive about this show is it balances faithfulness and approachability, covering so much content in just 8 hours but without feeling rushed. This makes it perfect for anyone who never got into one piece due to the intimidating episode count.

Additions and changes are kept to a minimum, and all serve to make the story more beginner friendly. Following Koby and Helmeppo is a great way to keep the pacing up.

Regardless, some omissions made for the sake of time are a real miss. One piece has always been about story more than fighting, but I hope that for future seasons (hoping we get them) we are treated to some of the inventive and wonderful fights the one piece series is known for. Watching Zoro and Sanji slap around extras for several minutes is far less interesting than their original 1v1 fights against fishmen in the manga. My guess is that the creators disliked the idea of giving characters vocal thoughts which are necessary for these kind of fights, but I say why not? Just because it's not conventional for live action doesn't make it bad, besides this show isn't exactly conventional anyway.

I can only hope that enough people appreciate this show to warrant more seasons, it's clearly a massive task in production and budget but One Piece deserves this adaptation, and this adaptation is worthy.",01-Sep-23,9.0,think everyone skeptical announcement live action one piece us expected fall way dragon ball death note cowboy bepop however oversight oda quality prevailed impressive show balances faithfulness approachability covering much content hours without feeling rushed makes perfect anyone never got one piece due intimidating episode count additions changes kept minimum serve make story beginner friendly following koby helmeppo great way keep pacing regardless omissions made sake time real miss one piece always story fighting hope future seasons hoping get treated inventive wonderful fights one piece series known watching zoro sanji slap around extras several minutes far less interesting original v fights fishmen manga guess creators disliked idea giving characters vocal thoughts necessary kind fights say conventional live action doesnt make bad besides show isnt exactly conventional anyway hope enough people appreciate show warrant seasons clearly massive task production budget one piece deserves adaptation adaptation worthy
"Grrat, and worth watching but ..","Let me start by saying that it's really enjoyable and I have been watching one piece since the start and have to say I really enjoyed it.

Most of the characters are done very very good including the straw hat crew (especially Zoro) and even some villains like Buggy and cudo which both were fantastic.

The only downside for me is the Arlong park .. In the anime it was soooo thrilling and I felt how tough Arlong and his crew were and how it was hard to defeat them but here I did not feel that at all and also Arlong character design just disappointed me .. I mean he is a sword fish guy so why didn't make the nose like sword fish even if it will be smaller than the anime ?? I really didn't understand that.

But despite any thing it's totally worth watching for any one piece fan out there and can't wait for more seasons.",03-Sep-23,8.0,let start saying really enjoyable watching one piece since start say really enjoyed characters done good including straw hat crew especially zoro even villains like buggy cudo fantastic downside arlong park anime soooo thrilling felt tough arlong crew hard defeat feel also arlong character design disappointed mean sword fish guy didnt make nose like sword fish even smaller anime really didnt understand despite thing totally worth watching one piece fan cant wait seasons
Loved watching the old storyline in a different way,"Big one piece fan. So I know what is gonna happen. I know the spoilers and I still watched it Some stuff has been missed which I understand because the anime series has over 1000 episodes and to follow each arc exactly will take too long, but as a real life adaptation I think it's great.

It made me smile, it made me laugh, it made me happy and it made me want to watch another episode. That is all I want a show to do.

It's not One Piece the anime series and it cannot follow exactly the plot lines. But it is awesome and it was great watching the old storyline in a different way.

Good show,"I hope Netflix doesn't do its usual and cancel this after one season. I thought it was enjoyable I knew nothing about the anime beforehand, but I really enjoyed the show. I thought all the performance was work quite well done and I enjoyed the storyline. Overall it was a fun show.. I thought the chemistry between all the characters was good and every time they introduced a new character they did a decent job of fleshing them out. Every episode had its own conclusion but the storyline continued over into the next episode so it was a fun show to keep up on. Did I binge it? No, not really, but I watched the entire thing over the course of about four days.",04-Sep-23,8.0,hope netflix doesnt usual cancel one season thought enjoyable knew nothing anime beforehand really enjoyed show thought performance work quite well done enjoyed storyline overall fun show thought chemistry characters good every time introduced new character decent job fleshing every episode conclusion storyline continued next episode fun show keep binge really watched entire thing course four days
"Bad casting, worse everything but a nice story","It's like these people never actually acted in their livesIt would also help if Netflix would stop using a random rainbow selection when casting. Luffy's similarity with the actor ends with long arms and legs. Nami is the worse. No similarity wahtsoever. And Usop, poor Usop. That's just embarrassing. Zoro is simply not grumpy enough. The actor failed miserably to capture the essence of Zoro, but at least he tried. Even Sanji's actor is lame copy. It didn't help that his behavior in manga is probably not nice enough for Netflix and couldn't be represented properly.

Screenplay is good, since it follows already written story.

I'm ashamed to say that I actually managed to watch all episodes. Yes, I'm an addict. I'll do better with next anime or manga Netflix tries to ruin.",05-Sep-23,1.0,like people never actually acted livesit would also help netflix would stop using random rainbow selection casting luffys similarity actor ends long arms legs nami worse similarity wahtsoever usop poor usop thats embarrassing zoro simply grumpy enough actor failed miserably capture essence zoro least tried even sanjis actor lame copy didnt help behavior manga probably nice enough netflix couldnt represented properly screenplay good since follows already written story im ashamed say actually managed watch episodes yes im addict ill better next anime manga netflix tries ruin

What we needed!,"As a fan of the manga since 1999, i must say!

This is a job well done!.. For me it took a couple of episodes to get used to the whole live action thing.

But they really did a great job.

Even if you're a fan or not, i fully recommend that you give this a try!

One Piece as a story does something to you, that most toget stories does not.

I hope that the Netflix adaptation, can deliver on some of the more in dept, and emotional aspects of the series to come.

I am intrigued to see what they will do when the power develop as well!

Huge One Piece fan but im caught up,Ive been watching one piece for about 8 years now and this will obviously start from the beginning. So if you are someone whos caught up (ep 1076 as of me writing this) its like going waaaayy back in time lol. It really wasnt bad but it just seems kind of useless if you are caught up. Or if the anime is available to watch. I see a lot of people saying they want more. Well then *watch the anime* its wicked good. Ill probably continue to focus on the anime over this tho because of course i wanna know whats next up in the anime. I was at one point caught up with the manga but anime to me is an easier material to digest and keep up lol. Now if they end up doing sabaody and marineford i will probably watch that.,21-Sep-23,7.0,ive watching one piece years obviously start beginning someone whos caught ep writing like going waaaayy back time lol really wasnt bad seems kind useless caught anime available watch see lot people saying want well watch anime wicked good ill probably continue focus anime tho course wanna know whats next anime one point caught manga anime easier material digest keep lol end sabaody marineford probably watch

The only short coming is you can tell the struggle of making a fantastical world like one piece live action but the characters and acting are on point. There are plenty of shot for shot scenes here and the areas that arnt still follow the story you love and keep the spirit of it as well. It earned its rating for all the right reasons.

A must watch,"If you browse there are series with more action than one piece, there are funnier ones, there are with more drama, you can search any specific aspect and you will find a serie that can beat one piece in that field... But one piece bring a little of everything and something unique, something you can't describe and you need to experience.

It's like the childhood nostalgia that we lose when we grown old, it feels like the kid we have inside and the dreams we had back then.

We all had dreams when we were childs, but when we grown up we adapt to the society, we try to survive or success, we do what everyone does to make more money, to get attract more women/men, to gain respect, to be better on what people think it is right... but what would happens if you choose to follow what you dreamed since you were a child? If choose to be free. That's what we are going to discover with these charismatic cast.

May be my review doesn't make sense to you, but it will when you watch one piece.

Very excited for what's to come!!!,"Even though a lot of people were hating on the trailers when they came out, I was able to sense a lot of passion and enthusiasm from everyone involved in the project and I was certain it wasn't going to flop. In fact I was certain that it would be great and I would enjoy it, which I did more than I care to admit.

Perfect it is not, but with practice, they could get better in other seasons. I still have problems getting into the stakes of it all and Luffy's fighting prowess is not clearly determined. The only change that felt ""lazy"" or ""cheap""(due to I am assuming CGI budget constraints) is Hachi's removal from the story. Not only because this would be a hindrance to the Sabaody arc ( if we even get that far), as he can be replaced by Kurobe, it also left Zoro without a final fight and he had to tag team with Sanji.

I also think Shanks's character and the portrayal of Haki in general were bland, however they are not as prevalent and wont be highly featured in the story for the arcs to come, so it kind of gets a pass. The lack of Sea Kings and other more complementary effects, I am hoping gets complemented with a higher budget for season 2.

I was sold on the world building, the comedy and the emotions they were trying to portray. Nami was my favorite in this aspect, as she made me emotional several times with her unwilling yet profound attachment to the crew and she really felt like a sister to the boys. Garp was fine and I am assuming he was highly involved to make sense and thread the loose ends which would have remained by cutting out some parts of the story.

Overall though It is an 8/10 for me, however I am giving it an 9/10 for it's potential (which I hope they don't disappoint) and the fact that so many anime fan wannabes and haters will give this a 1/10, just because it is getting good reviews and it is not their favorite anime (also because they are miserable and insufferable brats, albeit being 20+ years of age), without even watching a single episode.",03-Sep-23,9.0,even though lot people hating trailers came able sense lot passion enthusiasm everyone involved project certain wasnt going flop fact certain would great would enjoy care admit perfect practice could get better seasons still problems getting stakes luffys fighting prowess clearly determined change felt lazy cheapdue assuming cgi budget constraints hachis removal story would hindrance sabaody arc even get far replaced kurobe also left zoro without final fight tag team sanji also think shankss character portrayal haki general bland however prevalent wont highly featured story arcs come kind gets pass lack sea kings complementary effects hoping gets complemented higher budget season sold world building comedy emotions trying portray nami favorite aspect made emotional several times unwilling yet profound attachment crew really felt like sister boys garp fine assuming highly involved make sense thread loose ends would remained cutting parts story overall though however giving potential hope dont disappoint fact many anime fan wannabes haters give getting good reviews favorite anime also miserable insufferable brats albeit years age without even watching single episode

Don't sleep on it!,"Although I have never watched the original One Piece (saw that it was a ton of episodes and didn't have the energy to start it), but have been a fan of anime for a while now.

Initially, I was skeptical given the general butchering that have been released with anime adaptations... BUT decided to give it a go anyways, and this was surprisingly great!!

It's endearing, filled with action, and feels generally authentic - you can sense that the creators have given the anime justice and added some modern flare. The characters are extremely likeable and have great development despite only being 8 episodes.

Almost better than the original and that's saying something.,"I'm one of the few I suppose non-Japanese who have followed this show from the beginning, or at least from when the first English fansubs hit the net in the early 21st century. (I think the manga started in 1998 and the animation a couple years later? Damn that's nearly 25 years ago.) At first I didn't think much of the style of animation, I was a grown up by then and had left college - but returned to it and quickly got hooked following the animation well into my late 20s. I stopped watching it years ago shortly after the time skip (following the Whitebeard War) but have since read the Manga and though I got rid of most of my merchandise I still remember the show fondly despite being middle aged now, it remains one of the most exciting adventures and character building modern science fiction fantasy mythologies.

Oda did something special with this story with his unique assimilation of a bewildering number of historical and pop culture references, not least his now hundreds of characters being largely caricatures of famous Japanese, Hollywood or pop culture celebrities and musicians. As an Englishman I am particularly drawn to the representation of maritime history which as a maritime nation the British have played a large part in for good and/or ill. Funnily enough there is very little actual sailing or maritime lore in the story - it's clear that Oda has little sailing experience and chooses to focus on the characters and ludicrous scenarios - this doesn't make it any less interesting, just confuses me slightly that there is no real even reference to navigation or ship mechanics when most of it takes place on the water. This is transferred to the live action show though this at least has a few moments of navigation and references to port and starboard at least.

For some reason I ended up on IMDB today and One Piece was there - I headed to Netflix which I don't really use anymore and watched it all. The first few episodes were a bit low key, and seemed rushed - it was clear that there wasn't a huge budget with this one, but by the time Sanji turned up I was fully on board. It's clear that though there aren't as many special effects as the animation (that would have been prohibitively expensive and probably overwhelming) it's also clear that a lot of love has gone into this production - the casting was spot on. I remember reading a few years ago the nationalities of the Straw hat crew as defined by Oda for the beginning as it's hard to tell in the original as they all look Japanese and/or European (as realistically only Europeans generally have variation in hair and eye colour) and I was glad to see that they'd of course stuck with Oda's specifications of nationality - it was great in fact to see these represented for the FIRST TIME! As of course in the original they all speak Japanese and though they were speaking English and most of the actors are English or American, Luffy is clearly Brazilian (though it's unclear but of course not impossible that his gramps would be Scottish but with Scots roots myself this was a welcome addition and maybe Oda intended this as well)

It was clear that this show deviated from the manga storyline considerably for brevity's sake and for story progression - which actually was an improvement in some ways in terms of Nani's story particularly - though I must admit I would have liked more of Don Krieg but at least he was there for a moment - most of all I missed Jango he was hilarious. Kuro was very formidable and was seen making an escape so maybe he'll return I can't remember but I thought he was defeated completely in the original. The only thing that really hit me was Merry getting killed, he of course survived in the original story. And where was Richie? And the whole story with the mayor's dog? That was a real tear jerker - but would have been too time consuming.

Buggy the clown who is formidable in the original but of course a ridiculous character with even more ridiculous henchmen - is actually pretty unnerving and mildly terrifying in this adaptation and I suppose unsurprisingly somehow closer to the DC villain Joker at times in his intensity at least at the beginning - later on when he's a disembodied head and then runs off he becomes closer to his original. Of course fans of the manga will know that he appears multiple times especially during the Impel Down story ark, always offering comic relief, sometimes being almost an ally but usually reverting back to his devious, two faced or cowardly/self serving ways. It's a great character and I look forward to them further fleshing it out.

My only real criticism is that Zoro is meant to be Japanese and they didn't get a Japanese kid but an American actor who I understand from this page has been in several other anime adaptations. Also for his flashback which didn't look like Japan or Japanese actors but Americans and American 'karate kid' style approximation of what is supposed to be a Japanese dojo - I would have expected this for the 80s but not for a modern day production. Shame they couldn't insert this as it is based on a Japanese story so it would have been a nice kind of nod to the flavour of the original to have a Japanese character and an authentic jJapanese back story which feels much stronger and more fleshed out in the original. If they had delivered this it would have been 10 stars all the way but never mind - the actor who played Zoro did a great job. And I understand it might have been jarring to have the Japanese Zoro character and background contrast with the other parts of the story. I guess we'll never know.

Incidentally there is an Indonesian action film YouTube channel who made an amazing live action version of the Zoro episode of the animation which is closer to the original than the netllfix one - well worth tracking that down.

Despite everything the most important thing is: All the emotional beats hit home just like the original and I found that despite myself and knowing the story I teared up when Nami said 'help me'.

In all it felt slightly rushed but the casting was so perfect and the story was actually improved in so many places that I can't help but love it and hope that it goes all the way to the Whitebeard war and beyond - maybe even some live action movies. It's certainly probably the best anime adaptation ever made and stand-alone better than most of the mediocre stuff that jams up these bloated streaming services these days. I mean I know the human population has grown exponentially and along with it the volume of everything we create but it's just ridiculous nowadays he amount of mediocre junk being created. This is a long needed breath of sea air which hopefully represents a sea change and long may it continue and get the funding it needs - I know sadly (or maybe not!) it's not going to be 25 years long like the original (even though as Oda has stated in those 25 years only two or three years have passed in the story) because the actors will want to do other things and also would be middle aged by then, and generally if they don't get axed Netflix series rarely last longer than 5 seasons and this is particularly niche with it's weird fantasy elements and cartoon characters but we'll see. In fact it would make more sense if the show runs for something more like the actual time of the original.

Who knows, it might not make it as far as Franky and Water 7 which was an intense story arc (with a lot of filler!) but I can imagine it following at least the remake movies, we've already had the introduction of Baroqueworks so Smoker, Crocodile and Princess Vivi in season 2 then maybe Alabaster and then Drum Island with the introduction of Choppa in season 3... then maybe Fast forward to Franky and Robin in season 4 (though it would be very interesting to see how they do sky island, that was very weird!) And I certainly hope they get to probably my favourite section, 'Thriller Bark', which had some hilarious comedy horror but probably is funnier and more suited to cartoon as it's pretty freaky and probably not for children in live action!

Show is rated TV-14 only for a few scenes and the rest feels like it's rated PG. If you are going to go for a TV-14 rating then apply it through the whole show not a few scenes.

Never saw the original. Sooo....,"It's great that fans of the anime get the show they wanted, and the reviews pretty much reflect that.

But for those of us that didn't watch the show, this version was a little confusing...If this was strictly made for people that watched the show then that's fine, just let everybody know so we can plan accordingly.

There are soooooo many shows now with different worlds and ancient, detailed maps and it's hard to keep it all together. I'm assuming this show will be going for a while, based on the reception of the 1st season, so I would've appreciated a little more explanation as to how some things are strange (magical fruit, vampire swordsmen, snail phones, slightly problematic fish people) but others are incredibly normal (chefs cooking modern food with modern ingredients, modern fashion, racial justice monologues recited dramatically in public places to an audience of uncomfortable white people).

Sometimes it felt like jovial family entertainment. Other times it felt like an adult drama. There's cursing and a little nudity, but the dialogue comes off like an old soap opera. And I can't tell what time period this is supposed to be. The younger version of Luffy was just yelling all the time, which was Super annoying. And how old is the ""adult"" version supposed to be? His maturity level ebbs based on the situation so I can't gather an age.

The special effects were great, the makeup was pretty good. Some of the acting was really good, particularly from Nami. Emily Rudd played that part well. And the guy that played Mihawk. *chef's kiss* But I found a lot of the characters to be either unlikable or forgettable.

Idk...it just seemed like a weirder version of a lot of stuff I've seen before (with unnecessary yelling). It definitely wasn't the worst thing I've seen. I just don't really get the hype....yet.

Best live action adapt of anime,"They nailed this show, from the casting, fight scenes, and score.

Inaki Goldy and Mackenyu has done a phenomenal job getting into these characters. My favorite scenes are Zoro vs. #7 and the prison fight scene.

Decent fantasy action-comedy stands on its own,"I'm not a fan of the source material (although I could become one) and I'd never heard of One Piece past a few weeks ago, but I can understand why Netflix made the live action version -- it works pretty well on its own.

The world is novel, the characters are colourful and reasonably well-acted (from an action-comedy perspective), and the story keeps moving along. Of course the fantasy elements are a bit cartoonish (the source material being a cartoon) but much of the humour is found here and it all creates a fairly well-rounded package.

So, even if you've never heard of One Piece you should give it a try if you're a fan of fantasy action-comedies like Twisted Metal or Pirates of the Caribbean.

It's really good as a way to introduce people to the world of One Piece, especially for people who do not watch Anime, this will be a great way to get them interested.

The humour, the vibes were all well captured, just like it was in the manga and you could see the effort that went into making each of these episodes.

Where to begin,"So after the first episode, and all the changes, I admit I was nervous.

As a long-time fan who hates change I have a lot of trouble adjusting to anything slightly different than what I'm used to, but there's a moment in the first episode where it just *clicked*.

I won't post spoilers but I'll just say, cool pose 50 minutes in.

After that I let go of my concerns and annoyance at change and the show just...works. It's an adaptation capable of bringing in new fans without overwhelming them but with the characters all staying true to who they are in the Manga.

People in the live action may act differently than they do in the Manga, but it doesn't matter because the heart of the characters are there.

I laughed, I cried, I felt actual fear for the crew despite any foreknowledge.

Things were cut but it flows so well that even as a Manga fan I barely cared (there is still that part of me that hates change, I'm sorry).

The music, the sets, the actors, the cgi.

They pulled off things I was *sure* wouldn't come until later seasons.

Everything just meshed and fell together so perfectly. The subtle (and not so subtle) Easter eggs for early fans, and the character writing for brand new ones, all of it just worked so well that I'm already rewatching it after binging it the night prior.

You may not be a fan of anime, or One Piece, or even t.v. Shows, but this is a show that I think is capable of holding almost anyone's attention.

Show, don't tell, this adaptation captures that perfectly.

I truly can't recommend this show (and the Manga and anime for that matter) enough.

This was damn enjoyable as a massive fan of One piece,"I'll start by saying I've read through the manga twice. I watch both the English dub and Japanese version. And this show felt like such a love letter to fans. There is so much thought and care into keeping with the source material while also making some (not all) changes that feel natural that I can't help but feel pure joy watching this show. The casting for this show was immaculate, I think all the members for the main crew did a great job in bringing the often larger then life characters to a live action setting. I also have to give massive props to the actors for Buggy, Zeff, Dracule Mihawk, Shanks and especially Garp. Okay, let me talk about Garp now. His inclusion in this season was fantastic, maybe it's because I thought the actor who played him did such a good job, but he feels like such a natural inclusion. For those of you have read the manga or watched the anime you know that Garp only shows up in a cover story near the beginning of the manga and in two episodes near the end of the east blue saga which is where this show almost ends off at. But Garp isn't really introduced as luffy's grandpa until what would probably be the live actions equivalent of a season 4 or 5. I didn't know how I would feel seeing this character introduced so early into the live action, but he fit like a glove. He wasn't as dumb and as lovably goofy as his anime/manga version, which could be said for a lot of the characters ( Zoro and Luffy), but that's to be expected in a live action version. However, Garp's pride as a marine and as a grandfather to luffy. Are still very much there and I loved that.

Now for the things I didn't like, don't worry there isn't a lot. Most of my problems with the show are on a technical level. Some of the CGI wasn't great. I do respect the practical makeup and effects on the fishmen, but lord they were ugly. I remember seeing Arlong in the trailers and thinking yikes, however I grew to respect him cause then I saw some of the others and whoa. Other then that camera work was a big problem of mine. Why is it that in a lot of talking scenes the camera is so close to the actors face, when Nojiko is talking to luffy and the crew outside her house. All five characters in that scene got close up shots. Nojiko makes sense, she's on her side in her doorframe, but the other four are standing outside her house. You can even see the other three members out of focus in the shot when luffy speaks. Zoom out let the actors playoff each other show me theirs reactions in real time don't just cut to Zoro so I can see his reaction to what Sanji said.

The only other complaint I'd really like to talk about is episode 4 .This was the weakest episode in my opinion. This episode felt like the biggest change from the source material and not for the better. Maybe It's because Django wasn't in it maybe it's because there was no Usopp pirates. But I think for me It's because Koby and Helmeppos involvement felt so shoe horned in. They didn't do anything. They showed up said they were going to help, didn't help, then just left. Also, Zoro getting his backstory revealed because he was stuck in a well made no sense. Why not instead of Buchie and Sham throwing all three swords in the well Sham keeps the Wado Ichimonji sword cause it seemed rarer or special or any reason at all idk. And that triggers a response from Zoro when he wakes up to then climb out of a well to search for and find the sword he cares so much about. Letting you reveal why he cares so much about that one sword in particular. Just a thought. That scene bugged me as you might be able to tell.

All in all I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show. The Easter eggs, the references, the set ups for the possible future of the show. I think if you're a fan of the original source material I'd say give it watch there is so much to enjoy. I hope we get a season 2 just to hopefully see Jamie Lee Curtis as Dr. Kureha.

YES!!!!,"One Piece is an amazing series that has earned its place at the top of many peoples' lists of the greatest manga, anime, and just stories in general. Of course, it was inevitable that a live action series would get made. While most adaptations of the sort are met with negative reactions, this one had the original author, Eiichiro Oda, involved at every step of the way. So, does that make the adaptation better or worse?

I will start with the negatives. For one, a lot of what makes the world of One Piece work so well in anime and manga format does not translate to live action that well. The CGI is the obvious complaint to make, even though plenty of it looks good, but my complaint is more so about how some of the action scenes move. For example, Sanji will kick an opponent in midair, then just stop and fall to the ground as if he hit a wall, or there is one scene of Zoro sliding along the ground on his knees while slicing enemies. Granted, the characters are in a world with superhuman abilities, so the fights should not be grounded in reality, but some of the effects used to demonstrate great strength or speed are very noticeable.

Another anime element that doesn't work as well is the brightly-colored hair. The dyes or wigs used can be very jarring in some places. While it works seeing Nami and Zoro's bright hair in scenes with the rest of the vibrant Straw Hat crew, some scenes pop up where there will be several background characters with the normal blond/black/brown hair, and then a named character with a full head of bright blue or green hair just stands out like a sore thumb. In my opinion, it would have looked better if those characters had had their color mixed in with their natural hair, or maybe a duller shade used.

As a last complaint, I was a bit underwhelmed by Arlong. Both his acting and his appearance left a bit to be desired. While McKinley Belcher III is not terrible in the role, many of his lines felt like he was directed to deliver them with as threatening and growly of a voice as possible, and the result usually feels a little overboard in that regard. In addition, I feel Arlong could have been a little bigger. He always seemed like he would tower over almost everyone else, yet here he's only a bit bigger than the protagonists. But if the result would have made him feel too bulky and slow in the action scenes, small was the right choice.

However, those complaints are just three pieces of a larger puzzle that ultimately comes together to create an amazing picture. The rest of the show--sets, costumes, props, etc--look amazing. Everything is as close as possible to the original series. But unlike the radiant colors of the anime and colored manga images, everything in live action feels like there's a thin layer of dirt over it, adding grit to the pirates and company. Even many of the tackier costumes, such as ""Axe-Hand"" Morgan, still look like they belong in the world, and the makeup and prosthetics used to bring the fishmen to life are amazing. I complained about Arlong's size, but the rest of his design is amazing.

I also complained about the effects in the action, but otherwise it was amazing. All of the choreography and camera work was superb, bringing amazing action into every episode. Regardless of the scale of the fight, everything is captured smoothly, and there are never any cuts that make it too shaky and hard to follow. It's hard to pick a favorite out of so many.

The story is also great. These first eight episodes adapt the first one hundred chapters of the manga, and it keeps all the great moments while adding some new stuff. Characters and conflicts get introduced at new points and in new ways to help flow in the eight hours of screen time allotted, and they work to keep the story moving at a great pace. The biggest change is following the character of Koby for lengthy sections. While in the manga Koby leaves after the events of the show's first episode and doesn't appear until four hundred chapters later, here he's sort of a secondary protagonist as he begins his journey as a Marine. They also introduce his mentor Garp four hundred chapters early, and while it could have ended in disaster, I thought all of his scenes were great.

Another change they make is when they give the backstories of most of the Straw Hats. While all of their backstories are given in large chunks in the manga, here that only applies to Sanji, and Luffy and Zoro have theirs after their respective introductions. It helps the show get moving in media res, and Luffy's backstory was introduced at a good point to run parallel to the episode's events. Although I wish that Zoro's was given during one of his fights in the fifth episode, which is one of his biggest moments in the story as a whole, rather than in a scene original to the show. My problem is just the placement with the backstory though, as his contains some amazing scenery and an incredible action scene, along with some incredible young actors portraying the pirate hunter and his childhood friend.

On that note, the cast is easily one of the best things about the show. Even with my negatives about Arlong, everyone in the show does a great job, especially the Straw Hats. Their chemistry together is one of the most accurate details in any adaptation, not just this one, and it makes the emotional moments work even better as you buy their companionship, even if they haven't been together long. And out of all of them, I√±aki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy easily gives the best performance. Every action and line he gives is the definition of how the future King of the Pirates acts. I know that Oda had a big hand in the making of the show, but even so, I don't know how he managed to get such a perfect portrayal of his protagonist.

Finally, I can't end this review without mentioning the fantastic music by Sonya Belousova and Giona Ostinelli. They bring so much life into this already-life-filled world. I haven't seen the anime, so I don't know how much of the music is based off of its original music, but I still recognized the first opening theme ""We Are!"" when it showed up at pivotal moments. And plenty of other tracks are just as fun, often invoking the same feelings in me as the legendary soundtrack to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films.

I know it should be a nine but hear me out,"What the actual heck. They did the impossible, they made a live action anime show that isn't pure unadulterated garbage. Netflix actually learned the lessons from the disasters that were Cowboy Bebop and Death Note and actually decided to put real effort into this one. So that means they're listening. Also having Oda obviously helped a LOT. Now if they could PLEASE fix the muted colors. This show has the potential to become Netflix's very own Game of Thrones as long as they don't muck it up. Also the vfx needs a lot of work, especially if these episodes are costing them 18 million dollars each to make. The pros were pacing, the CAST, the cutting out the fillers. Hope this keeps going and we actually get to see Wano.",18-Sep-23,10.0,actual heck impossible made live action anime show isnt pure unadulterated garbage netflix actually learned lessons disasters cowboy bebop death note actually decided put real effort one means theyre listening also oda obviously helped lot could please fix muted colors show potential become netflixs game thrones long dont muck also vfx needs lot work especially episodes costing million dollars make pros pacing cast cutting fillers hope keeps going actually get see wano
Actors are an example of perfect casting,"When I watched the first episode bro, I gotta tell you it was just like watching the first episode of one piece for me. Except it didn't take 10 episodes to get out the first arc. Honestly man when I saw luffy, I was just like, it's luffy! Hes real! Same with all the other straw hats too, ESPECIALLY SANJI. Sanjis actor was just so good bro, the accent and the fighting is perfect bro. Not to mention his incredible relationship with Zeff in the adaptation, it felt real. Also sanjis kid actor definitely had the best acting out of all the kid straw hats, besides maybe nami. Zoros actor was good but at times the way he talked just sounded super corny and sounded like he was trying to be one of the alpha cool kids in school. Zoros child actor was also not very good imo, whenever bro talked I kinda just cringed and it hurt my soul man. Other than that though his actor killed the role, the fight scenes were great, probably the best in the whole show. And the scene after Mihawk where he said he would never lose again was great. It really captured zoros character in the way he showed so much emotion. Namis actor was also great, she was probably the one I have the least complaints about but she also doesn't really have many great positives I didn't expect like sanji did. She's just nami bro. Luffy was also good but was kinda like nami for me. Hes literally exactly what I thought of in a live action luffy. Ussop was the same, he was great, but just ussop. Which is great. Overall I want season 2 because this show is just one piece but better paced.",03-Sep-23,8.0,watched first episode bro gotta tell like watching first episode one piece except didnt take episodes get first arc honestly man saw luffy like luffy hes real straw hats especially sanji sanjis actor good bro accent fighting perfect bro mention incredible relationship zeff adaptation felt real also sanjis kid actor definitely best acting kid straw hats besides maybe nami zoros actor good times way talked sounded super corny sounded like trying one alpha cool kids school zoros child actor also good imo whenever bro talked kinda cringed hurt soul man though actor killed role fight scenes great probably best whole show scene mihawk said would never lose great really captured zoros character way showed much emotion namis actor also great probably one least complaints also doesnt really many great positives didnt expect like sanji shes nami bro luffy also good kinda like nami hes literally exactly thought live action luffy ussop great ussop great overall want season show one piece better paced
Good Adaptation that Can Make Itself Better,"Before I begin, let's be real for a second: even if it was made of something brown and smelly, I would still watch ever single minute of this. Because it is One Piece.

The adaptation is good, they didn't try to add everything to the show, which in my opinion would be catastrophic. There are things that work for anime/manga, which won't work for a live action. They did justice to it.

While I enjoyed the show, there is also something off with it. Think about the scene where Luffy comes out of the debris or the one with Nami and the hat, or the one where Zoro is crying after the fight with Mihawk... Those scenes looked like I was watching them in set, not on screen. What I mean is that the team should work better to add more feeling to what the actors are already doing. I am not a professional, so I can't say if it can be made with camera angles or some effects, but one thing I know is that some scenes needed more work and they lacked emotion and feel.

I am sure the team can take this to an even better level in next seasons and I sure hope it doesn't get cancelled.",07-Sep-23,9.0,begin lets real second even made something brown smelly would still watch ever single minute one piece adaptation good didnt try add everything show opinion would catastrophic things work animemanga wont work live action justice enjoyed show also something think scene luffy comes debris one nami hat one zoro crying fight mihawk scenes looked like watching set screen mean team work better add feeling actors already professional cant say made camera angles effects one thing know scenes needed work lacked emotion feel sure team take even better level next seasons sure hope doesnt get cancelled
A True Blue Anime Adaptation,"Devil fruit powers, monsters, human animal hybrids, and much more make this adaptation a challenging venture.

Best of the best,"This live action is fantastic with a fresh story that some of them can't find it on the anime.

The storyline, the ship, the cast, and everything was perfect. I love the way they make buggy look like. And Zoroo, he is so awsome by using the sword, and ofcourse I laugh when saw Usopp did hia thing haha..

My baby Luffy was so cute and Inaki play it right. So gratefull that I can be the part of the fans who really support one piece no matter what.

Sanji was cool and really love woman but not in cringe action. Love that. And really love Nami, she make me cry when she ask help...

Terrible! I don't understand all these positive comments and the hype,"TERRIBLE DIALOGUE DELIVERY AND ACTING BY THE CAST ESPECIALLY BY I√ëAKI GODOY.

I don't understand all these positive comments about One Piece Live Action. Since it is an adaptation of the anime it is understandable that the pacing and story are slightly different but the dialogue delivery by the actors is very cringy and terrible. They all just lack the essence of how the characters are in the anime. One thing that I can't get over is ""I√ëAKI GODOY'S TRASHY DIALOGUE DELIVERY"". The dude is just terrible when it comes to dialogue delivery and acting. This show is also horrible to watch in English. I am so glad they decided to bring the Japanese voice actors from the Anime to do the dubbed version.

What an amazing show!!!,As a one piece fan this show did everything I had hoped it would do and even better! I just LOVE the chemistry between the straw hats and how well and menacing all the antagonists looked. It was such a brilliant idea to turn kuro into horror psychopath villain because I always thought that it would fit his character so much when I watched the anime. There were some things that could have been done better but that is just me nitpicking as no show is perfect. Hats off to to everyone who worked in this project as you guys really deserve it. I seriously hope that Netflix will continue with the show and give us a second season because I really can't wait to continue this adventure with my favourite pirate crew!,02-Sep-23,9.0,one piece fan show everything hoped would even better love chemistry straw hats well menacing antagonists looked brilliant idea turn kuro horror psychopath villain always thought would fit character much watched anime things could done better nitpicking show perfect hats everyone worked project guys really deserve seriously hope netflix continue show give us second season really cant wait continue adventure favourite pirate crew
"A good watch for long time fans, but an ultimately unsatisfying and unsustainable telling of the story.","First: the things I liked I√±akis portrayal of luffy is near perfect for a live action Emily rudds portrayal of nami, while still noticeably removed from the original character, still is amazingly compelling, and the emotional scenes were perfect.

A lot of things that were added in later to the story as retcons are present from the beginning ie; Garp being luffys grandpa, certain characters being at rogers execution, much foreshadowing for future islands, Morgan capturing ""kuro"".

Merry actually dies, setting a good precedent on the live actions intent to change the history of ""fake out"" deaths in the series.

Almost all the dialogue is very well done, funny when it needs to be, but still serious and emotional at other times.

Things I didn't like: Ussops character is absolutely destroyed by the restructuring of the plot, he serves no purpose in this version, does nothing, even his dream, one of the most important aspects of his character, is introduced as an afterthought, and comes out of nowhere.

Zoros portrayal focuses much more on his aloofness then the rest of his character, to the point where when he actually cares about something, it feels out of place. He could benefit from a lot less deadpanning.

Sanji really had no impact on me, his character as a child was alright, but he just seemed so in the background in the present, even when it was focused on him.

Garp, why, I get wanting to introduce him into the story earlier, but his character is not done well. He orders mihawk to chase after luffy, which just is so out of character for him to indulge in the benefits of the warlord system. I kept expecting him to mention SWORD to Koby with how much they talked about corruption and personal justice, but he never did. It was also a missed opportunity to not have him talk more friendly with roger, as they do in flashbacks in the manga.

Shanks did not talk about how drawing weapons is basically forfeiting your safety to him, which I feel was important.

The whole restructuring of the plot is hit or miss at best, Arlong showing up at baratie was a good change, but as I mentioned syrup village was awful in every way, mihawks entrance to the story doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and even though the opportunity arose to have zoro protect his captain, he just challenges mihawk to a duel for being there.

The fight scenes are far and few between, and in a series where much of the characterization happens during fights, this change massively hurts the show. This is what I meant by unsustainable, as the series goes on the fights get more intense and the scale gets bigger, and the importance of battle emerges more and more, this first season does not give me high hopes for the future of its fights. The ones it does have are cut down to bare bones and are basically just talking with one or two attacks and it's over. I could get into more specifics but I'd be here all day.

TLDR; This restructured retelling of one pieces story, while exciting at parts and it certainly has its peaks, ultimately fails to encompass the full story and characters of the original series. That being said, I loved watching it, watching shanks put that hat on luffys head, hearing luffy scream his iconic ""of course I will"", and the barrel scene (minus ussops awkward inclusion considering the context of this adaptation) all had me smiling like a little kid, finally seeing my favorite series brought to life. I really do think that this series can succeed, but if the current trend continues, I just cannot see it getting past alabasta. I want this to succeed so badly, and I can see the makings of an amazing story, it just needs some reworking and a bit more action and time.",01-Sep-23,7.0,first things liked iakis portrayal luffy near perfect live action emily rudds portrayal nami still noticeably removed original character still amazingly compelling emotional scenes perfect lot things added later story retcons present beginning ie garp luffys grandpa certain characters rogers execution much foreshadowing future islands morgan capturing kuro merry actually dies setting good precedent live actions intent change history fake deaths series almost dialogue well done funny needs still serious emotional times things didnt like ussops character absolutely destroyed restructuring plot serves purpose version nothing even dream one important aspects character introduced afterthought comes nowhere zoros portrayal focuses much aloofness rest character point actually cares something feels place could benefit lot less deadpanning sanji really impact character child alright seemed background present even focused garp get wanting introduce story earlier character done well orders mihawk chase luffy character indulge benefits warlord system kept expecting mention sword koby much talked corruption personal justice never also missed opportunity talk friendly roger flashbacks manga shanks talk drawing weapons basically forfeiting safety feel important whole restructuring plot hit miss best arlong showing baratie good change mentioned syrup village awful every way mihawks entrance story doesnt make whole lot sense even though opportunity arose zoro protect captain challenges mihawk duel fight scenes far series much characterization happens fights change massively hurts show meant unsustainable series goes fights get intense scale gets bigger importance battle emerges first season give high hopes future fights ones cut bare bones basically talking one two attacks could get specifics id day tldr restructured retelling one pieces story exciting parts certainly peaks ultimately fails encompass full story characters original series said loved watching watching shanks put hat luffys head hearing luffy scream iconic course barrel scene minus ussops awkward inclusion considering context adaptation smiling like little kid finally seeing favorite series brought life really think series succeed current trend continues cannot see getting past alabasta want succeed badly see makings amazing story needs reworking bit action time
Pretty good for a live action,"This is definitely the best anime live action I watched. If rated in comparison to other shows and from the viewpoint of someone who didn't watch the anime a seven might be a bit to generous. This show is a hot mess and the heavily changed and rushed story looses most of its charm it has in the anime, especially because the East Blue Saga contains most of the weaker arcs of the show. I think it's time to finally drop this idea of anime live action as it just doesn't make sense and is mostly a watered down version of the original by loosing all the strength of the animation genre. Make good original shows again Netflix and lay off on the cash grab.",01-Sep-23,7.0,definitely best anime live action watched rated comparison shows viewpoint someone didnt watch anime seven might bit generous show hot mess heavily changed rushed story looses charm anime especially east blue saga contains weaker arcs show think time finally drop idea anime live action doesnt make sense mostly watered version original loosing strength animation genre make good original shows netflix lay cash grab
Everything I could have wanted,"This is not the anime and it is not the manga. It's an entirely brand-new interpretation of the story. It has the key themes, ideas, and mood, which is crucial to make sure it didn't betray the source material like other adaptations.

Most of these changes even enhance the original story by disregarding irrelevant story beats and combining multiple to improve the pacing, which is known to be slow in the anime.

The CGI was done incredibly well, and all the effort put into it is visible. This includes all elements of the show, where the passion and appreciation of the story spilling through the screen.

They Actually Pulled It Off,"As a OP fan for 18 years, I was hesitant to the idea of a live-action adaptation, but hopeful that they could pull it off.

Surely enough, all these years later, they've manage to open a door for new generations to explore the wonders of the One Piece world.

I'd never thought to see a Heath Ledger performance added to the Buggy character. He is definitely one of the show's highlights.

The character backstory of Sanji had me blown away. And the rest of crew's backstories for that matter. These were just meant for live-action.

Watched the anime and I'm obsessed with the live action,"Honestly if you watched the anime you have to agree they did a great job choosing the characters.

Excellent!,"Some who are avid, loyal fans of One Piece I've heard them say that ""its not thaaaat good."" With a shrug.* I've never watched the anime, or read the Manga series, but on my first night of watching it in a TV binge, it was sooooo good! A gripping plot line, silly, funny characters (apart from the creepy clown), Monkey D. Laffy was smart, funny, adorable, and hilarious with wit and humor. It was a really good binge watch in one night and was excellent despite what some fans say. Definitely a hit watch on Netflix for this year and I'm early awaiting for the second season if this manga-turned to live action.

"Not the Cartoon, but not bad...","I gave it a solid 7 & I think that's fair, maybe overly so. It is, of course, impossible to watch & not see the differences between this & the cartoon/manga. So, my smallest gripes are superficially about the differences & those differences are also superficial. Sanji's eyebrows & Usopp's nose. I mean, really? Why not. How difficult would it have been to give Sanji the eyebrows he so wickedly wears & is constantly referenced by. Silly brows... not difficult. Usopp's nose shouldn't have been much harder to fake & it too is missing. They gave most of the fishmen their prosthetics just fine... they managed the silliness of Merry's woolen head, Axehand, much of the fighting, a big damn fish, etc... So why not give us the man's nose. Not even a little bit. Just seems lazy.

But to the bigger gripes. Story. It's a modern trend that so many series are doin' so very few episodes/season. That sucks as far as I'm concerned, pretty much across the board. Add to that that this first season of only 8hrs shoved in something like 45 episodes. That's over 20hrs crammed into 8. Now, I don't need or even want all 20hrs. In fact, I'm kinda glad that some of the very bloated episodes/fight will be trimmed (Enies Lobby-yeesh) down... but at what cost. The everyone is loyal to Luffy feels forced & falls flat because there's been almost no time for that loyalty... The Garp is Grandpa felt rushed and premature... why was everyone so surprised when they've only known him for a week. Why would you think anyone wasn't his Grandpa? Did you take a list? Hell, you don't even know who his brother is yet... that will be far more exciting. Then there's the fighting. So far, not too shabby.... though I could see there was a smaller budget for the clean-up. No really. On more than one fight, it was just straight choppy. And Sanji's kick-ass kicks, especially at Arlong Park were stunted badly. Pretty all Sanji does is go girl crazy, smoke (also missing), cook, and kick.... and they're toning the girl-crazy down, pulled the smoking, and failing the kicking... I promise, his cooking is not so magnificently present to cover the loss.

So yeah... 7's fair, overly so. Mostly because, it is a very watchable show. I can only hope that more money is funneled into the fights & and a little more time given where needed. Because, while I'll be glad to lose hrs of Enies Lobby fighting... the Robin scenes in that arc are some of the best writing in the series to date & better not be lost to time...",03-Sep-23,7.0,gave solid think thats fair maybe overly course impossible watch see differences cartoonmanga smallest gripes superficially differences differences also superficial sanjis eyebrows usopps nose mean really difficult would give sanji eyebrows wickedly wears constantly referenced silly brows difficult usopps nose shouldnt much harder fake missing gave fishmen prosthetics fine managed silliness merrys woolen head axehand much fighting big damn fish etc give us mans nose even little bit seems lazy bigger gripes story modern trend many series doin episodesseason sucks far im concerned pretty much across board add first season hrs shoved something like episodes thats hrs crammed dont need even want hrs fact im kinda glad bloated episodesfight trimmed enies lobbyyeesh cost everyone loyal luffy feels forced falls flat theres almost time loyalty garp grandpa felt rushed premature everyone surprised theyve known week would think anyone wasnt grandpa take list hell dont even know brother yet far exciting theres fighting far shabby though could see smaller budget cleanup really one fight straight choppy sanjis kickass kicks especially arlong park stunted badly pretty sanji go girl crazy smoke also missing cook kick theyre toning girlcrazy pulled smoking failing kicking promise cooking magnificently present cover loss yeah fair overly mostly watchable show hope money funneled fights little time given needed ill glad lose hrs enies lobby fighting robin scenes arc best writing series date better lost time
"Not for me, but definitely give it a chance! (If you like any part of the show, check out the anime!)","As a giant one-piece fan I really feel like this lacked all the charm of One Piece, missed the mark, and was cringey at best.

To be fair, as a long time fan it is hard to look at it from an outside perspective. I'm hoping for the amazing creators sake, Oda, it brings more people to the anime! I would say if you enjoyed any aspects of the show definitely check out the anime!

They skipped over and manipulated quite a lot of scenes that added to the characters and story. I don't really understand much of the casting and the wardrobe/outfits/looks/etc were odd, especially for the budget Netflix should have.

Above average,"Lets be honest, the live action remake does not hold a candle to the real thing. But, lets see it as it's stand-alone self.

Some of the interactions feel a bit forced, but in general, it has a fun feel. The casting choices are simply magnificent, and the effects were brought to match. There is a bit of a lack of heart, and some scenes rush into relationship building. The focus should be shifted a bit for that balance.

Color me surprised.,"I am only 3 episodes in but I never expect they'd make a decent live action anime production. I certainly never expected that they could possibly produce One Piece in live action without it losing the essence of the original material. Thank you Oda for ensuring you had to give the approval for the parts you did. Although there were obviously changed aspects I have not once cringed or grumbled. I have laughed, smiled and very much enjoyed this experience.

They nailed Zoro in my mind and Luffy is still a blast. üëç I can only hope the remaining episodes keep up the solid work at success.

We want Season 2,"Eiichiro Oda is the mastermind behind the story üî• It was truly a pleasure to watch the series. Finished all 8 episodes and can say that it was perfectly adapted from the Manga though some changes were made to reduce the duration but it didn't affect any main plot. I definitely feel it's a must watch for both who watched/read the Anime/Manga and who didn't.

Finally an adaptation which isn't bad and now I can definitely suggest this to people who say anime is for kids and a cartoon. Now they can finally witness how great of a story One Piece is.

My favourite fantasy world brought to life blowing my expectations away,"I am an active member of the one piece community of more than 5 years and One piece might be the most difficult story to be adapted in a live action series. But Netflix pulled it off bravely and brought to us the best live action adaptation of a manga till date.

The efforts put by the whole team can be clearly seen The main thing that matters the most is Did they successfully capture the soul of the story?

Yes, they did Things that were a let down are Garp fells totally out of his character Casting of kid luffy is a miss by a lot Emotional moments didn't hold as much weight Benbeckman was miss.",07-Sep-23,8.0,active member one piece community years one piece might difficult story adapted live action series netflix pulled bravely brought us best live action adaptation manga till date efforts put whole team clearly seen main thing matters successfully capture soul story yes things let garp fells totally character casting kid luffy miss lot emotional moments didnt hold much weight benbeckman miss
Wow!,"Wow!! Incredible detail of realism with the original and not only that but the respect to be real without exaggerating special effects.

True fans will enjoy it and support this project which is a gift to them.

The actors are convincing and the casting is one of the best chosen in a long time in audiovisuals. The fights with wonderful choreography. Very elaborate and beautiful locations and photography.

There is no doubt that the heart is behind this great production. Heart put into respecting this huge series.

Butchering a masterpiece,"Sorry to be so negative but seriously: This series have successfully butchered the entire storyline of One Piece original anime. They have not even captured the characters essence or personalities. I have seen the anime and read the manga multiple times, I'm up to date to the latest episode. This series is just inspired by one piece but has almost nothing to do with the anime's storyline. The actors is mediocre at best and not fitting for the One Piece series. (They are probably good actors in anything else but in this series they are not.) A complete disappointment, I could have directed it better with no experience. Can not believe they wasted 18$ million dollars on each episode for this complete garbage. The people that have rated this above 5 star have never seen the anime or read the manga. Huge disappointment. Shouldn't be allowed to be called one piece. They could have done this so much better with the budget they had but they completely wasted basically every single dollar. This movie is a total abomination and insult to the anime. And I am sorry to say that the directors and story writers of this should be ashamed of how poorly done they have remade the masterpiece of one piece. I apologize for the bad review but as a one piece fan I truly had my hopes up watching every episode just hoping they would grow into this better.

absolutely love it,"As someone who is a fan of both anime and manga this live action captured the spirit of what one piece is.

"The ""Drums of liberation"" from curse of failed live actions??!","As, the biggest or longest one piece fan!

I wasn't disappointed. In fact this is something everyone should look forward to. The core reason behind this statement are ""people"" who worked so hard to adapt one piece to a different type of show rather than just going off with typical Hollywood stereotypes or ""we will make it better than the original by hiring unqualified actors or unprofessional directors "" This only works because it is one piece and Oda himself. This doesn't feel like something weak or stupid. This is well done with amazing planing, there were so many foreshadowed characters with well thought plans behind every episode.

I got what I expected,"I whatched the whole thing, and it was horrible.

I love One Piece, and its my favourite anime, but this was horrible. First lets go trough the charachters.

Garp was a totall miss. Firstly he didnt attend Gol D Rogers execution, secondly he wouldnt want to capture Luffy, and would even want to hire a Schibukai to capture him. Lets put the fact away that the whole show is not following the manga or the anime in the story. Still the characters should be at least the same.

All the arlong pirates were so badly made, i couldnt stop cringing about it. Like if thats how they look like, no wonder they are strongly upset all the time. Did the producer looked at the anime then the gjoyins and said, hmmmm pretty same to me??

(and what happened to Sanjis eyebrows???)

Also I watched it in Japanese, but all the shots was filmed in English, so the whole thing was off. It really destroyes the whole thing for those whou watched the anime.

The only thing was good in the anime, is the background and the atmosphere. It really gave back the feeling that we are watching a pirate series, but as soon as gjoyins or Luffy started to fight, it was just broken. I couldnt take it as serious as Zoro cutting Mr.7 in half. That was awesome btw.

So in conclusion, if you love One Piece, dont watch this, cus its terrible considered to the anime.

Amazing Job!,"As a fan of One Piece since 2017, I found the adaptation surreal, you can see the love they put into every scene, from the settings to the characters, maybe it's the best live action anime ever!

With the care of shortening the East Blue saga into 8 1-hour episodes, everything was well executed and they managed to leave the most important scenes of the saga, obviously it is not possible to keep it completely faithful to the manga, as it is an adaptation for the real world.

Despite missing some characters like Jango or Hatchan, it didn't affect my experience watching the live action.

It's all about diving into the crazy and unique world of One Piece that we all love.

Worth the watch,So this show was amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed it especially as a one piece fan I've been with the series since 2000 and I loved it. The live adaptation was definitely needed and it definitely propelled the genre to new heights. There has been a history of live-action enemies and they have all been garbage but one piece has definitely showed that live action can work but it will only work for the greatest anime of all time. The pacing was great and I really liked how they put together season 1. My only gripe is Zorro. I felt that they could have gave him a little bit more personality. Everything else was phenomenal. The fight scenes was beautiful the coordination was beautiful like literally everything else about the show was beautiful except for zoro's character. And I know what Zorro is like or at least from the anime and yeah just personality wise he could have had like a little bit more of improvement but other than that the show is literally 10 out of 10 for me and I really hope they at least do like five seasons cuz I mean honestly the show could go on for like a million seasons but you know I would have loved to see at least five seasons of the show.,03-Sep-23,10.0,show amazing thoroughly enjoyed especially one piece fan ive series since loved live adaptation definitely needed definitely propelled genre new heights history liveaction enemies garbage one piece definitely showed live action work work greatest anime time pacing great really liked put together season gripe zorro felt could gave little bit personality everything else phenomenal fight scenes beautiful coordination beautiful like literally everything else show beautiful except zoros character know zorro like least anime yeah personality wise could like little bit improvement show literally really hope least like five seasons cuz mean honestly show could go like million seasons know would loved see least five seasons show

Netflix's One Piece Live-Action: Navigating the Grand Line of Adaptations - A 7.5/10 review.,"My review of Netflix's live-action adaptation of One Piece, which I would rate a solid 7.5/10, is mixed but leans positively. It's better than most live-action adaptations I've seen, but it has its share of highs and lows.

1. **Better than Any Live Action Adaptation**: In my opinion, this adaptation surpasses the majority of live-action adaptations out there, managing to capture the essence of the One Piece world.

2. **Excellent Cast, Especially the Main Crew**: I was genuinely impressed with the casting choices, especially for the core members of the Straw Hat crew. The actors embodied their characters remarkably well. The standout here was undoubtedly Buggy's actor, who nailed the role perfectly.

3. **Great Cinematography, Action, Okay VFX**: Visually, the series shines with its superb cinematography and action sequences that evoke the adventurous spirit of One Piece. While the visual effects were serviceable, they didn't push any boundaries.

4. **Living World of One Piece**: The world-building in this adaptation was a highlight. Every element added to the story, the intricate backgrounds, and the scenes made the One Piece universe feel genuinely alive and immersive.

5. **GARP's Character Arc**: However, one of my biggest disappointments was the handling of Garp's character. They deviated significantly from his original personality as a Marine Hero, making him appear as a whiny, incompetent man-child obsessed with his grandson. This drastic change felt both disappointing and unnecessary, and the explanation that it was all just a test was a letdown.

6. **Casting of Shanks' Crew**: The casting choices for Shanks' crew raised eyebrows. While diversity is important, it shouldn't overshadow the authenticity of the characters. The portrayal of characters like Ben Beckman and Black Lucky Roux didn't match their status as formidable members of a Yonko's crew.

7. **Luffy vs. Arlong Fight**: The Luffy vs. Arlong fight left me wanting more. It felt disappointingly short and lacked the intensity and emotional impact of the original. It failed to capture the essence of Luffy's unwavering determination to protect his friends.

8. **Minor Plot Issues**: There were minor plot issues, such as not adequately explaining Sanji's motivation for joining the Straw Hats and omitting key scenes like his touching moment of bowing to Zeff. The Syrup Village arc felt unnecessarily prolonged, and it didn't give Usopp the character development he deserved. Placing Zoro's childhood in Syrup Village felt forced and out of place.

Despite these shortcomings, I still found enjoyment in the series and would be eager to see a potential season 2. With some refinements and staying truer to the source material, Netflix's One Piece adaptation could further solidify its position as one of the better live-action adaptations out there.",05-Sep-23,8.0,review netflixs liveaction adaptation one piece would rate solid mixed leans positively better liveaction adaptations ive seen share highs lows better live action adaptation opinion adaptation surpasses majority liveaction adaptations managing capture essence one piece world excellent cast especially main crew genuinely impressed casting choices especially core members straw hat crew actors embodied characters remarkably well standout undoubtedly buggys actor nailed role perfectly great cinematography action okay vfx visually series shines superb cinematography action sequences evoke adventurous spirit one piece visual effects serviceable didnt push boundaries living world one piece worldbuilding adaptation highlight every element added story intricate backgrounds scenes made one piece universe feel genuinely alive immersive garps character arc however one biggest disappointments handling garps character deviated significantly original personality marine hero making appear whiny incompetent manchild obsessed grandson drastic change felt disappointing unnecessary explanation test letdown casting shanks crew casting choices shanks crew raised eyebrows diversity important shouldnt overshadow authenticity characters portrayal characters like ben beckman black lucky roux didnt match status formidable members yonkos crew luffy vs arlong fight luffy vs arlong fight left wanting felt disappointingly short lacked intensity emotional impact original failed capture essence luffys unwavering determination protect friends minor plot issues minor plot issues adequately explaining sanjis motivation joining straw hats omitting key scenes like touching moment bowing zeff syrup village arc felt unnecessarily prolonged didnt give usopp character development deserved placing zoros childhood syrup village felt forced place despite shortcomings still found enjoyment series would eager see potential season refinements staying truer source material netflixs one piece adaptation could solidify position one better liveaction adaptations
It should not be adapted for TV.,"No no no no and no. Again. Except that it looks shot with an iPhone 14 Pro (Netflix, no budget for a pro camera and a better photography director? Really?), it seems to be on stage at Comicon. A bad Comicon event. It could really be better in every point. Casting, photography, music, direction, ecc.. I know difficult is translate a media like a Manga/Anime on a TV show, but... How is it possible that with we have had such this 'plastic' effect with all the money Netflix have?

Kudos to the entire team behind this adaptation,"Just finished watching the One Piece live action adaptation on Netflix, and WOW!

I've seen my fair share of live action versions of manga comic books, but this one truly takes the cake. It's not an easy task to bring such an iconic series to life, but Netflix managed to do it impeccably.

Every scene, every character, every moment felt so genuine and true to its roots that there were times I felt like I was back, flipping through the pages of the comic or binge-watching the animated episodes late into the night.

From the detailed sets, impeccable casting, and gripping story arcs, to the heart of what makes One Piece so special - it was all there, and I was truly blown away. Kudos to the entire team behind this adaptation. It's a testament to the magic that happens when passion and dedication come together.

You have to watch this show as it's own thing.,"This adaption of one piece has left a lot of people very happy, and a lot of people quite sad. Personally, I agree with both sides, and I understand the main reason why.

1. It is not an accurate adaption: A lot of creative liberty's, new scenes, things not generally featured in the manga/anime (and changing usopps race for some reason). The thing you need to understand going into this show is that netflix has not made this show to adapt one piece, more to use it's general plot and do some necrophilia to the corpses of how they get to the conclusion of the arc. Think of one piece (live action) as it's own show, instead of an adaption.

If you can't take the fact that this show is not an adaption, then do not watch it. They have changed so much that you will probably not enjoy it.",06-Sep-23,8.0,adaption one piece left lot people happy lot people quite sad personally agree sides understand main reason accurate adaption lot creative libertys new scenes things generally featured mangaanime changing usopps race reason thing need understand going show netflix made show adapt one piece use general plot necrophilia corpses get conclusion arc think one piece live action show instead adaption cant take fact show adaption watch changed much probably enjoy
The best Live Action Adaptation of Anime,"I think adapting a series well revered as this was a great challenge and I think their efforts weren't in vain and we got a pretty solid adaptation for a series that could have gone completely off track

While there certainly are changes I'm not a fan of, the cast killed it, and the fights were entertaining. They've truly found some fantastic real life counterparts to the manga. Every antagonist save for Garp could've been handled way better.

I slightly like One Piece Live Action version of Romance Dawn Arc better than the original in the Anime or Manga.

While i'm myself not of a fan of Syrup Village Arc even in the Anime or Manga, the adapation in this is kinda dissapointing to say the least. The only thing really nice on this Live Action Adaptation on this arc is how Kaya and Nami had a late-night conversation.

I also didn't like at all the fact that Luffy heard Nami's story, neither that the villagers didn't know the truth about her. Both of these things were so beautiful and downright poetic in the manga or the anime, but the Live Action just removed them, which is a shame.",03-Sep-23,7.0,think adapting series well revered great challenge think efforts werent vain got pretty solid adaptation series could gone completely track certainly changes im fan cast killed fights entertaining theyve truly found fantastic real life counterparts manga every antagonist save garp couldve handled way better slightly like one piece live action version romance dawn arc better original anime manga im fan syrup village arc even anime manga adapation kinda dissapointing say least thing really nice live action adaptation arc kaya nami latenight conversation also didnt like fact luffy heard namis story neither villagers didnt know truth things beautiful downright poetic manga anime live action removed shame
The show is great and well made. Few casting choices are terrible.,"Listen I think this show is good, has so many amazing qualities and they nail some of the casting choices in lead roles, except Coby. This has nothing to do with him being trans, but has everything to do with just being a poor actor. Constantly making faces of fear and confusion and indecision. It's not believable. It's not good acting. And for having such a a central role, it's hard to keep watching cause every time he is on screen, I'm cringing and genuinely annoyed. The role of Kaya similarly has very cringe moments. I don't like constantly rolling my eyes in every episode because a character can never land a line or just looks like they have never acted before. One piece nails sets and pacing. But it did not nail the casting. And that sucks cause it keeps it from greatness. Its worth watching. Maybe the acting doesn't effect you the same way.",20-Sep-23,8.0,listen think show good many amazing qualities nail casting choices lead roles except coby nothing trans everything poor actor constantly making faces fear confusion indecision believable good acting central role hard keep watching cause every time screen im cringing genuinely annoyed role kaya similarly cringe moments dont like constantly rolling eyes every episode character never land line looks like never acted one piece nails sets pacing nail casting sucks cause keeps greatness worth watching maybe acting doesnt effect way
BIG One Piece fan - way better than I expected,"Overall I have some issues. The emotional moments cold have been better - some of the flashbacks did not hit the same way as in the anime - I was dissapointed with Zoro's flashback, but maaan, Sanji's one was f...ing awesome !!!

As for everything else, the guy playing Luffy was just spot on, I can say that the entire cast is almost perfect. The sets and designs, the CGI was pretty decent.

It's like watching a One Piece love letter retold by fans.,"Honestly, for a live action it was solid. If you don't go into it comparing to the anime you will enjoy the adaptation. The show's settings were gorgeous, fight scenes were very fun to watch, and the story telling gets to the point (faster than the og anime season 1 where it felt like a chore to get through an arc). I also think the crew's actors nailed their roles - for the most part.

Must watch.,"To be honest, I didn't have any expectations, but I never thought it would be made this well. Unlike countless other examples of live-action film failures, this is so fun. Please watch a lot so that the next season comes out. Unnecessary time-consuming episodes were boldly eliminated and important scenes were presented realistically. Long live the director. The actors' acting is also natural and not overdone. The selection of actors was also very appropriate.

An adaptation that shows respect towards the original material while still being its own thing,"This is a great way for newcomers and long time fans alike to connect with the series. The cast is spot on, their chemistry onscreen (and off screen, if you follow the promotional material) is everything we could hope for, the script is a faithful representation to the spirit of One Piece and the set is really immersive. The love and respect put into the production are really visible. And there are so many cool ships!!! I'm glad they used CGI sparingly because the real life sets, prosthetics and animatronics are what distance the series from the fake and uncanny valley status, as it had a lot of potential to be off-putting. It is not perfect, there are some cringe lines and pacing issues due to limited screen time, but to me it feels just perfect enough. I highly recommend it.

One Piece Live Action,"From Many Years, Many Animes Were Trying to Make Anime into Real Life But Most Of Them Failed , Honestly Everybody Didn't had any expectations for one piece live Action but after watching One Episode.

I just changed my mind I watched all 8 episodes in single night . Everything from cast to set was perfect. This live action really fullfilled the pacing of anime . This is the most watch live action.

My fellow Indians Also It's Hindi Dub is Really Awesome and the voice of Zoro Sanket mhatare Is Fire .

Blown away!,"I loved this so much. Honestly need a 2nd season asap.

From the point of view of someone who hasn't seen the anime yet, but I'm going to now, this show is simply amazing. It had me cheering every episode. Be it because of the characters, the story-line, the great, (sometimes ridiculous and predictable) dialogue or the very anime-like visuals. I loved every second of this show.

Although Luffy would certainly make sure to get everyone around him in trouble, I would definitely not mind being part of his crew.

I recommend everyone to watch this show.

Damn good in its own way,"It's damn good, tho live action cant potray the same same anime or manga, it may skip some parts and create it's own story, but Oda, the original creator of the manga supervised all the changes, the dialogues and what not, so It's done pretty damn right.

You may refrain from liking it if you are a big fan of manga but maybe try to see it as a standalone story, just try, and see for yourself and easily you begin to enjoy it.

It is a fantastic watch for Fans and Non-fans alike!,"As someone who hasn't seen the anime or the manga this show surprised me in the best of ways. It's so full of life and fantastic acting you can tell everyone cared deeply about the source material unlike most adaptations these days who fill their content with characters that have the emotional range of a wall. Or fill the plot with unnecessary political agendas or claims for ""diversity"" at the expense of the story and the fans who already love these well known characters. One piece is a gem among loads of Chloe. From well written characters to grand horizons that are paired with amazing scores of music. I cannot recommend this show enough and I hope it continues to get renewed by Netflix for the foreseeable future.

The best live action anime rendition ever made.,"Been a long time anime fan. And always wanted to watch one piece, but could never get past the first few episodes or clips here and there. This live action rendition is absolutely perfect. I was hesitant to watch at first but finished all 8 episodes at once. Perfect casting amazing CGI and from the clips I've seen of one piece over the years it stays true the story. I've seen so many of my faceorite anime butchered in live actions but this one did the opposite and I'll be picking up the anime right where the show left off. And there's possibly enough episodes to tie me over until this show gets its second season.

The Mandalorian of Anime Live Action Anime,I had Not Hope that this will BE good but i Got many suprises. You can Tell alot of people WHO worked on one piece Loved the actual Manga and Anime so much Details and easter eggs. Episodes 1-2 Starts alright but after Episode 3 you are on the Hook. I Loved almost every actor Luffy nailed it He Played His role almost identical Like He is moving around and being naive good minded Happy Attitude very talented actor also Nami nailed it too every Scene with her seemed interesting. The Others are great too except Kid Luffy i did Not feel much at His scenes there have should been a better Kid actor for him but He has Not many scenes. The whole world building IS great feels very vibrant and Alive the costumes are great and the Locations Look all awesome except flying lamp a little too Creepy. Some stuff are Missing but only stuff where the Main Story IS Not pushing Forward and the Budget and time was Not there to do IT. The sad Moments Hit pretty good i felt Like watching one piece AS a Kid for the First time on TV all the emotions come Back Happy and sad and to do this IS a proof that the directors did great Work! Thanks to them the series IS a big success. IT feels very high Quality Like a Disney Marvel and Star wars Show and feels Like Pirates of caribic or Harry Potter the world seems very interesting and with og music the one piece Feeling come Up. The fighting Scenes are alright too hard to make the Like the Anime without cgi overuse but they did a good Job. ITS good for people WHO never watched the Show because IT has 1000 episodes or they dont watch Anime to Bring the awesome Story to them. Oda did Everything Right !

Look like One Piece but it's not One Piece.,"This show is somewhat faithful to the manga and anime.

The story, the characters, the design is similar to the original. And that the only good thing about this show.

In other hand it also very different from the anime/manga.

There are a lot of big, unnecessary change that directly effect the quality of the show.

The overall tone is darker and more serious, a lot of characters and plot line is gone.

Some character and plot line should not be there was add to the show.

The characters personality is different.

The storytelling is different.

It's missing the emotional connection of the original.

This show may look like the original but it doesn't feel like it. It's lacking the essence of the original.

Without comparing to the original. I have to said that Almost every thing about this show is just okay at best if it not bad.

The visual is not good and weird.

The music not memorable .

The sound design just ok.

The action, ok fight choreography but bad camera work and bad editing ruining it.

Bad special effect, considering the money that they spend.

Acting is bad, too much overacting. A lot of time feel forced and awkward.

Set design, like the original but doesn't have the feel. Everything look fake.

Guns, swords, house look like plastic. The building, street, city and village look to modern like real world.

Dialogue, sometimes feel like the original but doesn't translate well in to live action so it feel cringe and unnatural.

Other time too much like Hollywood or other American drama but doesn't fit well with the tone of the show.

Writing, directing, editing is just ok, sometimes bad.

The pacing, sometimes too slow and feel dragg.

Other time too fast make story feel rush.

There is no flow to the story. The plot is interesting but become boring because of bad storytelling.

This show is just not nearly as good as everyone said it is.

If i haven't read the manga or watch the anime i would think this is an ok show.

But when compare it to the Manga/Anime then it is bad.

The biggest mistakes that the show made was to be an exact copy the original and also straight to far from the original at the same time.

There are things that should not be adapt to the live action because it not translate well in real life but they put it in the show anyway.

And there are things that should be in the show because it actually fit well with the show and it a important part of the original but they cut it out or change it for the worse.

The people who made this either don't fully understand the original or don't have the skill to make it good.",02-Sep-23,4.0,show somewhat faithful manga anime story characters design similar original good thing show hand also different animemanga lot big unnecessary change directly effect quality show overall tone darker serious lot characters plot line gone character plot line add show characters personality different storytelling different missing emotional connection original show may look like original doesnt feel like lacking essence original without comparing original said almost every thing show okay best bad visual good weird music memorable sound design ok action ok fight choreography bad camera work bad editing ruining bad special effect considering money spend acting bad much overacting lot time feel forced awkward set design like original doesnt feel everything look fake guns swords house look like plastic building street city village look modern like real world dialogue sometimes feel like original doesnt translate well live action feel cringe unnatural time much like hollywood american drama doesnt fit well tone show writing directing editing ok sometimes bad pacing sometimes slow feel dragg time fast make story feel rush flow story plot interesting become boring bad storytelling show nearly good everyone said havent read manga watch anime would think ok show compare mangaanime bad biggest mistakes show made exact copy original also straight far original time things adapt live action translate well real life put show anyway things show actually fit well show important part original cut change worse people made either dont fully understand original dont skill make good
ok so far,"When this came out I started watching the anime series to familiarize with it and did not care for it. This live version is entertaining so far. I like the actors performance but the pink hair girl marine candidate needs to expand on her facial expressions. She is always looking scared and confused. Just watched Evil Dead Rise with the same actress appearing in it. Yet again she displays a one dimensional facial expression, the same scared and confused look the whole time. The war ship vessels and sea creatures are very cool, adding a lot to to the vibe of the shows story.

Anime live actions can be good,"I'm a huge One Piece fan, and I went in on this show knowing that it was most likely gonna get ruined by Netflix, but I ended up with a huge surprise instead.

This show only gets better with each episode. It is absolutely unbelievable how good it is.

They managed to get all the emotion from the first 100 manga chapters in just 8 50-ish minutes episodes. And not only that, but they still had room for changes and improvement.

I loved all the changes they did.


Using outfits from covers and other sources
Making Usopp's nose normal so he can kiss Kaya
Involving Garp, Koby and Helmeppo from the beginning of the story
Mihawk finishing Don Krieg before Baratie
Showing Zoro and Baroque Works' backstory


But probably the most important change of all, even if it might seem not that important, is the death of Merry.

We all know Oda hates killing characters, and pretty much all the deaths happen in flashbacks and not in the actual story. BUT, if they went on an killed Merry (which btw gave it even more emotion to the ship, because they named it after him), that means that they're going to kill even more characters in future seasons. And some of them might be brutal, seeing how they didn't care to show Zoro literally cutting in half Mr 7 (or Helmeppo's butt).

Other stuff I loved was the casting, it was absolutely on point (but I disliked the way some of the actors portrayed the caracters). The costumes were pretty good, though they need to work a bit more on this, because Kuro looked way too much like he was just cosplaying, and his minions looked really goofy. The fight choreography was stunning. Also, the vfx and cgi looked really good, specially Luffy's attacks, but other things like Zoro's swords falling apart after fighting Mihawk, and the explosion on Garp's ship caused by Luffy looked really bad, so there's still room for improvement on that.

There were other things I liked and disliked, for example how some conversations feel unnecesarily long.

But one thing I'm not sure how to feel about is how short the fights are. Like, yes it makes sense to get defeated irl after getting gomu gomu no gatling'd, but I also feel like we didn't get to see just how strong Luffy, Zoro and Sanji really are, and it's something I want to see next season.

Overall, the good points far outweigh the bad ones. And the changes they did made it a great adaptation.",17-Sep-23,10.0,im huge one piece fan went show knowing likely gonna get ruined netflix ended huge surprise instead show gets better episode absolutely unbelievable good managed get emotion first manga chapters ish minutes episodes still room changes improvement loved changes using outfits covers sources making usopps nose normal kiss kaya involving garp koby helmeppo beginning story mihawk finishing krieg baratie showing zoro baroque works backstory probably important change even might seem important death merry know oda hates killing characters pretty much deaths happen flashbacks actual story went killed merry btw gave even emotion ship named means theyre going kill even characters future seasons might brutal seeing didnt care show zoro literally cutting half mr helmeppos butt stuff loved casting absolutely point disliked way actors portrayed caracters costumes pretty good though need work bit kuro looked way much like cosplaying minions looked really goofy fight choreography stunning also vfx cgi looked really good specially luffys attacks things like zoros swords falling apart fighting mihawk explosion garps ship caused luffy looked really bad theres still room improvement things liked disliked example conversations feel unnecesarily long one thing im sure feel short fights like yes makes sense get defeated irl getting gomu gomu gatlingd also feel like didnt get see strong luffy zoro sanji really something want see next season overall good points far outweigh bad ones changes made great adaptation

Thank you!,"The adaptation is very very good. I could have some minor complaints, but everything is trivial, since the whole package is sooo goood. Biggest complaint would be how they changed Garp's character and 2 inconsistencies in the Kaya mansion arc. I also notice grading inconsistencies (it's my job), seems like you rushed it at the end, but ok.

Id rate it 9/10, but considering how the story hasn't really started yet, and that I have faith in the production team to learn from the experience and only do better from now on.. I'll rate it 10 in advance.

Please, keep the same work attitude. Give us the story humanity deserves.

Thank you One Piece,"I dont know anything about the manga or about the anime series but growing up as a kid in the 80s, early 90s, in a communist country, and the rare opportunity to watch VHS movies like The Goonies or The NeverEnding Story was overwhelming in those days, so I always dreamed of big adventures wandering around the woods around my hometown with my friends looking for new places to explore and discover, One Piece brings me back to those childhood memories, having great friends who share everything, supporting each other in good or bad in joy and sorrow.

I would love to see live action for captain tsubasa, naruto and Dragon ball. The colors of each scene are also very eye-pleasing. They should release the next season in 2024.

Uninvolving,"The series suffers from some flaws, some predictable but bearable, others avoidable. Oda's work made emotional involvement and emotional build-up leading up to the climax of the fights one of the main points.

This element is completely missing in the live action and one does not feel the least bit involved in what should be the characters' suffering, their moments of despondency and defeat. The epic swordsman clash is treated too superficially, Mihawk is supposed to put psychological pressure on Zoro, who as an underdog realises that he is inferior and tries to attack him in every possible way realising that his opponent is actually playing with him... when completely defeated, bleeding, about to receive the coup de grace on his back he turns to receive it on his chest.

This is treated completely differently, which makes the final promise, with the sword raised, without any emotional involvement. The same construction errors are repeated in other important moments. Good product if you have never read or seen one piece.

BEST LIVE ACTION EVER,"Finally My favorite manga/anime got the best live action. The live action is 1000% better than I expected. Everything is so beautiful.

CGI, the cast, the environment, storyline, costumes, everything is really good. I watched one piece anime from Ep 1 to over Ep 1000 for 3 times and also read Manga and also watch the reviews, theories videos of many One Piece Youtube Content Creators. Of course, I know a lot more about One Piece and I can say this live action of One Piece is really well done.

Even though there are some parts I want to get a little bit better but still really really good.

WOW SO GOOD!!!!,"Peak fiction. Best thing I've ever seen. Made me laugh made me cry made me shiver me Timbers. It did it all. The people nitpicking are comparing it to the anime when this is its own thing. For what it's SUPPOSED to be it's amazing. Especially since it's the first time running, I had no idea it'd come out this hood. Main concern was cgi but they killed it. The cast was perfect and the execution was perfect. And beginning got me hooked and the end made me sad it was over. I watched it all in one night and felt like I was watching one piece all over again. They had reasons for the changes they did and I respect them.",01-Sep-23,10.0,peak fiction best thing ive ever seen made laugh made cry made shiver timbers people nitpicking comparing anime thing supposed amazing especially since first time running idea itd come hood main concern cgi killed cast perfect execution perfect beginning got hooked end made sad watched one night felt like watching one piece reasons changes respect
Best anime adaptation but can't quite reach the original,"Going into this I was quite sceptical and nervous but most of that went away after watching the first couple of episodes and getting a feel for this new version of the world we grew so accustomed to. It's a lot less goofy/silly than the anime and the comedy has been toned down but I think it nevertheless captured the essence of One piece for the most part. And I am relatively optimistic for the next season. However, there are a several issues that I couldn't ignore though, some more important than others, and it's why I couldn't rate this too highly.

Firstly, the villains' sizes and bodies will have to be adjusted. Looking at this live action, characters like Arlong and Axe-Hand Morgan did not seem intimidating enough like in the original animation, their size and powerful figures have been toned down and I think that takes away from the sense of dread that we animation watchers felt when watching our characters go up against them. So hopefully they will have better CGI and they will be able to get the villains to feel a bit more like Thanos in the Avengers, or at least achieve the same effect through better angles and shots that emphasise their power.

Secondly, this might be just a me problem, but it's kind of a let down that they took away a lot of the aesthetics and music of the original animation, it would have been great to have the nice little intro titles at the beginning of an episode that were in the original anime and the really iconic music from the series. Maybe even somehow incorporate that nostalgic narration of Gold Roger's dying words but this might be a bit too much to ask for.

Thirdly, this might be due to them just testing the waters with this new series, but I believe that the series is way too short to fairly present the compelling and complex story, narratives and emotions of one piece. A lot of the relationships and connections between characters seemed to happen a bit too quick and many important parts of character development in the original anime's arcs/storylines were omitted due to them trying to fit everything in such a small package. You simply can't condense multiple dozens of episodes of content in just 8 episodes. I believe that the next season needs at least 15 if not 20 episodes to get even close to fairly present the next arcs. Also hopefully the episodes can be released one by one weekly so that we can really digest each episode and appreciate it on its own merit while getting excited and theorising for the next episode.

Finally, and this is very important, please make the fight scenes more compelling and challenging. Currently, a lot of the fights seem to go along the lines of characters randomly throwing punches/attacks without thinking and getting a lucky hit in the end, whereas in the original animation we saw the characters really thinking and strategising over how to win their fights and finding the enemies weaknesses. So, especially going forward with smarter and more talented villains, I really hope the strategy and thinking in the fights improves so that the victories feel actually deserved and accomplishing.

Perfect balance between new and old,"Watching One Piece since 1999 and while watching the first episode i got the exact same feeling i had 24 years ago. Then couldnt stop and binged the series through until 1 am.

While the original series needs often to much time to tell the story and gets boring at some points for a few episodes, the LA-Series is able to cut the story down to its essence, while correcting some mistakes in character building made in the original (cause this characters showed up again like 5 years after their first appearance, obviously Oda didnt plan this long forward at this time).

The Series also didnt look like an anime transforming into a real movie. It concentrates on the things and even add some new things a movie is good at and cuts out the things that only work in animes and would look cringe.

The 8 episode series looks also more like a movie octology, then a series.

If you are interested in pirates of the Caribbean setting, fight scenes and humor, combined with some super powers, thats a must see.",01-Sep-23,10.0,watching one piece since watching first episode got exact feeling years ago couldnt stop binged series original series needs often much time tell story gets boring points episodes laseries able cut story essence correcting mistakes character building made original cause characters showed like years first appearance obviously oda didnt plan long forward time series also didnt look like anime transforming real movie concentrates things even add new things movie good cuts things work animes would look cringe episode series looks also like movie octology series interested pirates caribbean setting fight scenes humor combined super powers thats must see
NO ONE MESSES WITH MY FRIENDS!!!!,"I have never written a review for anything on IMDB, but this is special. I fell in love with One Piece almost 8 years ago, and it's been one hell of a ride. This show taught me so much and I've grown as a person because of it.

After I heard that the live action series was coming out I was skeptical. Netflix had bombed their last few live action anime adaptations and I was worried that One Piece would follow the same trend.

I COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE WRONG.

This show is One Piece at its core. Sure, some plot elements are different than the anime, but they captured the essence of One Piece, and I am so glad I watched it.

Unexpected satisfaction,"The series will be judged and reviewed with the context of what it is: a live-action adaptation of a story that spans 20+ years and 1000+ episodes. I believe that I can talk for most people, when I say that it has exceeded all expectations.

Story: The story is compressed and modified, but, still, it delivers all the core ideas unchanged.

Characters: The characters' portrayal is accurate, only missing the cartoon-comic element.

Acting: The acting is very good, fitting the needs of the story. Very good choice of actors for most roles.

Fights: The most unexpected victory of the adaptation: the fights. Given that it is extremely difficult to bring an anime fight into live-action, the producers, choreographers, and special effect teams have done very good. Despite the short duration and number of fights, which is understandable considering the cost of all those special effects, they are very well done. I am glad that they focused on quality over quantity in this area, even if some people are disappointed, because they wanted more action.

Overall, an extremely good adaptation, considering the context. It might be a little bit chaotic and confusing, if this is someone's first contact with the One Piece world.",01-Sep-23,10.0,series judged reviewed context liveaction adaptation story spans years episodes believe talk people say exceeded expectations story story compressed modified still delivers core ideas unchanged characters characters portrayal accurate missing cartooncomic element acting acting good fitting needs story good choice actors roles fights unexpected victory adaptation fights given extremely difficult bring anime fight liveaction producers choreographers special effect teams done good despite short duration number fights understandable considering cost special effects well done glad focused quality quantity area even people disappointed wanted action overall extremely good adaptation considering context might little bit chaotic confusing someones first contact one piece world
My personal opinion of the beautiful series One Piece,"Except for the big difference between the anime and the real-life series. I witnessed an amount of creativity and good acting. Luffy's character was played well. I had a lot of fun watching the series since the first episode. I'm very excited for season two. It was really amazing.

I look forward to seeing more creativity. I thought it would be a good idea if they did a Mihawk movie. Because the one who played his role made me re-watch his scenes several times.

I have always dreamed of watching this beautiful anime in reality. I feel like one of my dreams has come true. Many thanks to this wonderful crew of actors and cameramen.

Went into this non biased and expecting the worst, but surprisingly found myself entertained, laughing, and wanting to see more. Great job netflix and hope to see more. The cast for luffy is kind of cringe at first but as the show continues you grow to find him very childlike as luffy in the manga and anime. Zoros character is hands down the best casted along with the ussop character. I know there are still many issues that need to be worked on as far as CGI with luffys rubber scenes, and certain characters who physically don't look like there anime counterparts, but I think Netflix did an amazing job with what they had to work with.",01-Sep-23,10.0,great live action adaptation adventures strawhat pirates pacing great action packed great visuals fun time watching went non biased expecting worst surprisingly found entertained laughing wanting see great job netflix hope see cast luffy kind cringe first show continues grow find childlike luffy manga anime zoros character hands best casted along ussop character know still many issues need worked far cgi luffys rubber scenes certain characters physically dont look like anime counterparts think netflix amazing job work
I watched One Piece in my early days,"During my formative years, I harbored a profound admiration for a particular anime series that left an indelible mark on my memories. The zenith of my fascination culminated in the climactic confrontation between two vice-admirals on a remote island, an event that unleashed elemental forces, transforming the battleground into a spectacle of fire and ice.

As I reflect on the series, a myriad of impressions flood my mind, each reminiscent of a journey that transcended mere fandom. The evolution of my sentiments towards this anime unfolded organically, reaching a crescendo during the intense clash of vice-admirals on that fateful island.

What ensued was a pleasantly surprising revelation that transcended my initial expectations. The series, with its intricate plot and character dynamics, stood as a testament to the meticulous choices made by the directors. Admittedly, some of these choices at the outset were jarring, causing a momentary dissonance in my viewing experience. However, as the narrative unfolded, it became evident that these seemingly bold decisions were deliberate, a calculated risk that ultimately paid off.

In the grand tapestry of the series, these directorial decisions seamlessly wove together, underscoring a genuine commitment to capturing the essence of the story and the profound journeys undertaken by the characters. It was a realization that the directors weren't merely orchestrating a visual spectacle; they were, in fact, stewards of a narrative that delved deep into the intricacies of character development and plot progression.

The narrative, while condensed compared to my recollections, skillfully distilled the essential background stories of each character portrayed within its expansive storyline. This condensation, rather than diminishing the richness of the narrative, served as a testament to the adept storytelling prowess employed in presenting a cohesive and engaging tale within the constraints of the medium.

Enter Netflix, the platform that brought this anime to life in the form of a live-action adaptation. Skepticism loomed large as I embarked on this new viewing experience, given the infamous track record of live-action adaptations often falling short of capturing the magic of their animated counterparts.

To my delight, the live-action rendition surpassed expectations, standing out as a shining example among the plethora of adaptations. In fact, it can be boldly asserted that this Netflix adaptation ranks among the best live-action productions witnessed in recent memory. The fidelity to the source material, coupled with a commendable attention to detail, ensured that the spirit of the anime was not only preserved but also elevated in this new iteration.

Netflix, often criticized for its hit-or-miss adaptations, can bask in the success of this venture. The nuanced storytelling, coupled with impressive visual aesthetics, marks a turning point for live-action adaptations, setting a high standard for future endeavors in the realm of anime adaptations.

In conclusion, my journey with this anime, from fervent fandom to a renewed appreciation through its live-action adaptation, stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling. The directors' initial choices, though initially startling, were instrumental in crafting a narrative that transcended the boundaries of animation and seamlessly transitioned into the realm of live-action. In the annals of anime history, this series and its successful adaptation stand as a shining beacon, illuminating the path for future endeavors in the ever-evolving landscape of storytelling.",30-Sep-23,9.0,formative years harbored profound admiration particular anime series left indelible mark memories zenith fascination culminated climactic confrontation two viceadmirals remote island event unleashed elemental forces transforming battleground spectacle fire ice reflect series myriad impressions flood mind reminiscent journey transcended mere fandom evolution sentiments towards anime unfolded organically reaching crescendo intense clash viceadmirals fateful island ensued pleasantly surprising revelation transcended initial expectations series intricate plot character dynamics stood testament meticulous choices made directors admittedly choices outset jarring causing momentary dissonance viewing experience however narrative unfolded became evident seemingly bold decisions deliberate calculated risk ultimately paid grand tapestry series directorial decisions seamlessly wove together underscoring genuine commitment capturing essence story profound journeys undertaken characters realization directors werent merely orchestrating visual spectacle fact stewards narrative delved deep intricacies character development plot progression narrative condensed compared recollections skillfully distilled essential background stories character portrayed within expansive storyline condensation rather diminishing richness narrative served testament adept storytelling prowess employed presenting cohesive engaging tale within constraints medium enter netflix platform brought anime life form liveaction adaptation skepticism loomed large embarked new viewing experience given infamous track record liveaction adaptations often falling short capturing magic animated counterparts delight liveaction rendition surpassed expectations standing shining example among plethora adaptations fact boldly asserted netflix adaptation ranks among best liveaction productions witnessed recent memory fidelity source material coupled commendable attention detail ensured spirit anime preserved also elevated new iteration netflix often criticized hitormiss adaptations bask success venture nuanced storytelling coupled impressive visual aesthetics marks turning point liveaction adaptations setting high standard future endeavors realm anime adaptations conclusion journey anime fervent fandom renewed appreciation liveaction adaptation stands testament enduring power storytelling directors initial choices though initially startling instrumental crafting narrative transcended boundaries animation seamlessly transitioned realm liveaction annals anime history series successful adaptation stand shining beacon illuminating path future endeavors everevolving landscape storytelling

LOVE EVERY SECOND!,"This show is definitely one of the best shows that I've seen, yes, shows, not live actions. I loved every second of it, acting was amazing! It definitely lived up to the hype that centered around it. The story of course, had a bit of changes to properly adapt it to live action, and that is understandable.

It has the heart and joy that the legendary manga made by Eiichiro Oda-sensei and I loved everything about it. With him overseeing the production of the series, of course I had faith. Why would I ever doubt him? The key elements are there, the pivotal moments for characters are there, but there is one key moment that was missing for me, that is the removal of the fight with Don Krieg to make it seem that Arlong is the final villain to make him more intimidating, it was fine for the most part, but it made me feel that Sanji's arc was weak, but overall, the series is amazing! Can't wait to see more!!!",01-Sep-23,9.0,show definitely one best shows ive seen yes shows live actions loved every second acting amazing definitely lived hype centered around story course bit changes properly adapt live action understandable heart joy legendary manga made eiichiro odasensei loved everything overseeing production series course faith would ever doubt key elements pivotal moments characters one key moment missing removal fight krieg make seem arlong final villain make intimidating fine part made feel sanjis arc weak overall series amazing cant wait see
100% SUCCESS LA seen so far.,"Finally!! Watched OPLA.

Idk why some people whining and complaining like hell OP did something WRONG. Do they even know that 99% LA are failure and it's near impossible to show exactly and perfectly as ANIME/MANGA shows?? Coz w are here humans and those r fictional characters with thousands kinda different powers and art.

Atleast watch other Live Adaptations before complaining lol. Allow me:- Attack on Titan, Death Note, DBZ, Cowboy Bebop, Bleach......and then decide for One Piece LA. Don't get me wrong, I laughed like hell while watching AOT LA and hardly watched 2 episodes with huge patience.

If we compare OPLA (One Piece Live Action) with other Live Actions. I'd say this LA is a pretty damn success. Doesn't matter what some HATERS cry.

But if someone is a new Audience Know this - OPLA has 97% Critics Positive Reviews. Believe in Critics coz Most the time Critics give fair reviews and this OPLA has just POSITIVE reviews from critics.

Decide whether this LA is good only if you've seen some other Live Actions and how they are.

I'd definitely recommend this as for new audiences who really want to know one of the GREATEST AND BIGGEST STORY EVER WRITTEN IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

Don't stick with LA. It just acts like a Carrier to get you a little idea about the Story. For the real entertainment, I'd always chose MANGA of ONE PIECE. Just a reminder, this MANGA is the BEST selling surpassed Batman, spider man, HARRY POTTER, Lord of Rings and every single Comic so far and just behind Superman. Think about why people tend to love this Story and invest their TIME AND MONEY coz it's something one in a lifetime show/journey/experience.

Try Anime too, no one would've thought a poor animation which started in 1999 could be one of the best Animation now in 2023. This Anime broke Almost every single record in Animation, choreography. There are many records it's Anime made none ever made and Maybe ever will in future.

From last couple of YEARS Animation is Above God Level.

Guys shouldn't just follow Animation, quality f story is Good, Animation doesn't matter atleast to me.

In last I'd like to say, don't Listen to anything I said or anyone anywhere. Try yourself, watch with positive approach and decide for yourself whether you'll watch more. But trust me what happens in live action is not even close to a tip of iceberg. There's a whole godamn ocean of better story remaining.

Also try Anime- in starting Animation isn't good and a little slow but if you guys watch till 50 episodes and still don't like it. DROP IT. It's not your type Show but atleast watch 1st 50 episodes before dropping.

How can I forget MANGA - it's the best thing ever if you read MANGA.

Conclusion:- OPLA is a success if you ask me. If you're otaku, you'll feel a little less innit. Just know Live Adaptations are just meant to get you guys an idea of any fictional storyline ( of MANGA, Anime).

There are DOZENS of Live Adaptations of more popular shows and watch those too if you wanna compare and give opinion.

"Has its flaws, but still a lot of fun!","As a fan of the anime, I was a little sceptical when the news broke that there was going to be a live-action adaptation of One Piece. The trailers didn't exactly knock my socks off, but of course I had to watch the show to get my own impression. And admittedly, some of the costumes look like cosplay and some of the fights, especially the fight against Captain Morgan in the first episode, lack the lightness we know from the anime. Of course, this is only to be expected, as this is a live-action adaptation and therefore not fully comparable to an animated production. Still I thought the fights were lacking a little bit in general. In the end, however, I surprisingly had a lot of fun with this series, and that is mainly due to the fantastic actors, who have a wonderful chemistry with each other and embody their roles very well. The show also manages to find serious and emotional moments in between the many action-packed and funny scenes. Some of the visual effects are also worth seeing. If the few obvious flaws can be ironed out, then this is a very promising series. More of it, please!",03-Sep-23,7.0,fan anime little sceptical news broke going liveaction adaptation one piece trailers didnt exactly knock socks course watch show get impression admittedly costumes look like cosplay fights especially fight captain morgan first episode lack lightness know anime course expected liveaction adaptation therefore fully comparable animated production still thought fights lacking little bit general end however surprisingly lot fun series mainly due fantastic actors wonderful chemistry embody roles well show also manages find serious emotional moments many actionpacked funny scenes visual effects also worth seeing obvious flaws ironed promising series please
Mixed Bag...A waste of opportunity mostly.,"I have been following One Piece for 10 years. I am up to date with manga and unfortunately dropped the anime due to it's horrid pacing later on, and I am still following from the manga.

Now, I will try to review different aspects as fairly as possible. This show isn't bad, but they failed at some core aspects that made One Piece special. Let's discuss positives and negatives.

Positives Good Action: The Action scenes overall are pretty decent. Not the best I have seen but they are quiet decent. I would even say it is much better than the original anime due to it being released at 1999 with very old animation.

Zoro/Mackenyu: Zoro's actor and dialogue are very spot on. They nailed one of the 5 core cast...at least.

Negatives:

Luffy: I was aware Luffy from anime 1 to 1 would not work, and I am not trying to discredit its actor. It is clear he gave his effort but...The writers butchered Luffy's dialogues totally. Luffy is supposed to be a no nonsense, stupid yet stubborn guy that gets what he wants, albeit he is very clumsy and stupid. However in this live action...Luffy is 80% talk and 20% action. Luffy is all about SUBTLETY. He won't talk long dialogues full of vulnerability and hesitation, he is someone that talks less about meaningful stuff but when he talks about them it is always to the core/heart and shows his character. Luffy should have been way more subtle in his morals. He is not someone that goes around saying I am a good pirate, etc etc over and over again. He is someone that shows with his ACTIONS. Not words again and again. Over the course of the series, people say Luffy is special and even compare him to Gold Roger. But the new audience probably has no idea what makes Luffy special. If I was a first time watcher I would have no idea as well. Luffy is extremely stubborn and determined. He gets bloody, injured, insulted but he can always nonchalantly and stubbornly get over it. In the live action he either always needs help for his own battles or doesn't struggle significantly. His biggest struggle in live action was buggy, which made him psychological attacks about shanks and his hat. He was not challenged or proved his worth with Arlong fight. He didn't show his character's worthy traits well enough.

Arlong Park Arc: While Nami's flashback was okay...Everything else was very bad. Arlong Park is the soul of east Blue Saga. It should have been THE best and most built-up arc. However, none of the characters get character development or any challenge.

Zoro: Zoro's duel while being injured was completely removed. Instead he just slashed some fishman effortlessly.

Sanji: Sanji's ideals about chivalry was mocked and tested by Kuroobi in the manga which he after a great struggle both mental and physical overcame Kuroobi and achieved growth. This was all removed.

Usopp: Usopp's all struggles about facing his fears and being ashamed of his own thoughts about abandoning the fight were removed. In a very bad CGI Usopp just hit the alcohol bottle and boom. The fight was over in a second. Usopp was unscathed. This was an extremely terrible writing choice. This was Usopp's redeeming moment for all the cowardly acts he committed all other arcs, this was his first major growth moment. He beat a fishman without getting a single scratch, without any struggle, without any tension, without any growth. And the fight ended so anticlimactically...The show focused more on Helmeppo, than Usopp! Netflix really butchered Usopp by removing his scene in this arc.

CGI is not good nor bad. It is okay...Normally One Piece's East Blue Arc has a slow start but with Baratie and Arlong Park, should have peaked with growth from all characters. But characters remained static and they completely butchered the Arlong Park arc. Nami's flashback was okay...but wasn't well executed enough. Overall if the writers for dialogue didn't suck, if they didn't make stupid waste of time on Garp, Coby and Helmeppo with the limited screentime and INSTEAD, developed the MAIN CAST's CHARACTERS...This could have been an 8/10 or 9/10. Honestly so much wasted potential. If this show continues, which I am currently neutral about, fire the dialogue writers, make the new writers read the manga, then FORCE THEM to learn about Character Development, and how it is a bad idea to cut characters moment's in an extremely character driven show. A show doesn't become successful when you just take the scenes but not the soul of a story.

Overall, it is better than other live actions. At least backstories are mostly fine, not butchered. Action is fine. Zoro's actor is good. Side character's actors are really good, like Helmeppo, Alvida and Buggy was awesome. It was the biggest highlight in the dragging later half of the show. However, we didn't see anything worth seeing from Luffy, the crew didn't struggle or grow nearly enough, and their chemistry felt shallow due to the lack of growth and staticity of the characters.",31-Aug-23,6.0,following one piece years date manga unfortunately dropped anime due horrid pacing later still following manga try review different aspects fairly possible show isnt bad failed core aspects made one piece special lets discuss positives negatives positives good action action scenes overall pretty decent best seen quiet decent would even say much better original anime due released old animation zoromackenyu zoros actor dialogue spot nailed one core castat least negatives luffy aware luffy anime would work trying discredit actor clear gave effort butthe writers butchered luffys dialogues totally luffy supposed nonsense stupid yet stubborn guy gets wants albeit clumsy stupid however live actionluffy talk action luffy subtlety wont talk long dialogues full vulnerability hesitation someone talks less meaningful stuff talks always coreheart shows character luffy way subtle morals someone goes around saying good pirate etc etc someone shows actions words course series people say luffy special even compare gold roger new audience probably idea makes luffy special first time watcher would idea well luffy extremely stubborn determined gets bloody injured insulted always nonchalantly stubbornly get live action either always needs help battles doesnt struggle significantly biggest struggle live action buggy made psychological attacks shanks hat challenged proved worth arlong fight didnt show characters worthy traits well enough arlong park arc namis flashback okayeverything else bad arlong park soul east blue saga best builtup arc however none characters get character development challenge zoro zoros duel injured completely removed instead slashed fishman effortlessly sanji sanjis ideals chivalry mocked tested kuroobi manga great struggle mental physical overcame kuroobi achieved growth removed usopp usopps struggles facing fears ashamed thoughts abandoning fight removed bad cgi usopp hit alcohol bottle boom fight second usopp unscathed extremely terrible writing choice usopps redeeming moment cowardly acts committed arcs first major growth moment beat fishman without getting single scratch without struggle without tension without growth fight ended anticlimacticallythe show focused helmeppo usopp netflix really butchered usopp removing scene arc cgi good bad okaynormally one pieces east blue arc slow start baratie arlong park peaked growth characters characters remained static completely butchered arlong park arc namis flashback okaybut wasnt well executed enough overall writers dialogue didnt suck didnt make stupid waste time garp coby helmeppo limited screentime instead developed main casts charactersthis could honestly much wasted potential show continues currently neutral fire dialogue writers make new writers read manga force learn character development bad idea cut characters moments extremely character driven show show doesnt become successful take scenes soul story overall better live actions least backstories mostly fine butchered action fine zoros actor good side characters actors really good like helmeppo alvida buggy awesome biggest highlight dragging later half show however didnt see anything worth seeing luffy crew didnt struggle grow nearly enough chemistry felt shallow due lack growth staticity characters

Excellent - please more!!!,"At the beginning, I had my doubts about the One Piece anime in real life, but I must admit, I was completely wrong. It was absolutely mesmerizing.

First of all, the different types of ONE PIECE writing at the beginning of each episode were genius. The themes in every situation, such as when a villain appears or Captain Black, or the first flashback of Nami's childhood, really immersed you in that world. I also like the fact that they changed the story a little bit to make it more realistic for the live-action series. Of course, there are some points that are missing, but we should not forget that this is not an anime in this case, and the story remains the same.

I love every character, from Corby to Nami or Garp. It's neither too little nor too much. I can't understand the negative reviews.

I've had an incredible experience with the One Piece Live Action adaptation.,"Watching it in the original Japanese with the returning voice cast from the anime added an authentic touch to the series. I'm excited to rewatch it in English for a fresh perspective.

What sets this adaptation apart is its balance between loyalty to the source material and making necessary changes for the live-action format. Unlike some adaptations that lose the essence of the original, this one maintains the core concepts of One Piece while crafting a unique experience.

I'm happy it has ""too much original source""

I√±aki Godoy deserves special recognition for his portrayal of Luffy. His performance truly brings the beloved character to life, capturing his optimism, seriousness, and fun-loving nature.

Emily Rudd's dedication to Nami is evident in her acting, and she seamlessly embodies the character's personality, from her fighting skills to her thieving antics.

Mackenyu's portrayal of Zoro is spot-on, delivering the right blend of seriousness and playful humor. Jacob Romero excels as Usopp, even without the long nose, nailing his storytelling and body language.

The entire cast shines, and their chemistry is evident on screen. This live-action adaptation is a testament to the dedication of everyone involved. Having Eiichiro Oda, the manga creator, on board was a brilliant move, and it's clear that his influence added depth to the series.

I appreciate that the creators didn't compromise the integrity of One Piece for the adaptation. Despite minor deviations, the essence remains intact. This, to me, is the best anime-to-live-action adaptation to date, and I'm thrilled with the outcome. I commend the efforts of Matt Owens and others who maintained a balance of seriousness while consulting Oda for authenticity.

It is as real as it could be.,"Well people need to understand that that real life adaptation of a anime will never b as good as anime itself.

You dont have much flexibility and it needs a huge budget.

I just hope that they dont prolong with useless details of anime. Anime had a lot of filler even in good episodes. They need to make it short and precise.

And most importantly they dont make nami and other crew of luffy as useless as they are in anime. They also need to show more of shanks keep it interesting . Unlike anime people are going to watch useless episodes with usless info.

I hope they continue and release one season every year.",09-Sep-23,10.0,well people need understand real life adaptation anime never b good anime dont much flexibility needs huge budget hope dont prolong useless details anime anime lot filler even good episodes need make short precise importantly dont make nami crew luffy useless anime also need show shanks keep interesting unlike anime people going watch useless episodes usless info hope continue release one season every year
Very good!,"I really liked this adaptation! Netflix delivered on everything it promised! Because it is an adaptation, it has things removed and scenes changed but, taking into account other live action anime, this one is much superior to the previous ones. The costumes, the scenery, the characters are all very well done! Negative points: The special effects could be better, even having few cgi effects and most being practical I found it very simple! As they are adapting 60 episodes in 8, I found the events very fast! I highly recommend this live action, especially for people who haven't seen the anime, to get to know this magnificent work!",04-Sep-23,8.0,really liked adaptation netflix delivered everything promised adaptation things removed scenes changed taking account live action anime one much superior previous ones costumes scenery characters well done negative points special effects could better even cgi effects practical found simple adapting episodes found events fast highly recommend live action especially people havent seen anime get know magnificent work
Breaking the Anime Adaptation Curse,"The amount of care they put into everything absolutely shows. Not only is it a fairly straight adaptation that will delight fans - the level of detail right down to using the same fonts on clothes and signage - but how they truncated whole arcs to fit inside of two episodes is a masterclass in how to truncate. Nothing feels rushed or cut to bits; the pacing is satisfying and doesn't leave room to feel bored. They didn't ""4Kids"" this either so you definitely won't be watching a sanitized adaptation.

I√±aki Godoy as Luffy, Mackenyu as Zoro, and Jeff Ward as Buggy are standouts, but Godoy (for me) makes an even more delightful Luffy than even his characterization in the cartoon. He's an absolute joy to watch. Instead of forcing a character trope, he really pulls you in with his sincerity and makes it impossible not to root for him.

Whether you're a fan of this anime, anime in general or just like goofy adventure, this show is highly recommended for a fun viewing.",02-Sep-23,9.0,amount care put everything absolutely shows fairly straight adaptation delight fans level detail right using fonts clothes signage truncated whole arcs fit inside two episodes masterclass truncate nothing feels rushed cut bits pacing satisfying doesnt leave room feel bored didnt kids either definitely wont watching sanitized adaptation iaki godoy luffy mackenyu zoro jeff ward buggy standouts godoy makes even delightful luffy even characterization cartoon hes absolute joy watch instead forcing character trope really pulls sincerity makes impossible root whether youre fan anime anime general like goofy adventure show highly recommended fun viewing
"Overall, Major Success!","As a HUGE, mega One Piece anime fan, I was so nervous- and cautiously excited. Each trailer had me more and more excited, but I still had some reservations.

Now, first, there are a few things I'm not totally happy with. But 99% of my current complaints are about condensing 43 episodes into 8, and the small differences from the original product. The other 1% is about the funky camera angles.

That said, I am blown away. I was enthralled. It's truly an amazing show, and I can't say enough about the AMAZING cast. You can tell the cast and crew really poured their heart into it. I'll be waiting not-so-patiently for season two!!",01-Sep-23,10.0,huge mega one piece anime fan nervous cautiously excited trailer excited still reservations first things im totally happy current complaints condensing episodes small differences original product funky camera angles said blown away enthralled truly amazing show cant say enough amazing cast tell cast crew really poured heart ill waiting notsopatiently season two
It's fine....,"I don't understand why I see so many reviews giving this 8,9 and 10 stars... I think this is happening because fans are watching the show and are just so relieved that it isn't completely butchering the anime/manga they're just kind of too awestruck to pay much attention? Or I just pay way more attention than is necessary to enjoy something?

This show is fine. It does one thing well, it doesn't completely change the plot, characters and meaning of the original work. That's it.

Everything else though, is mid leaning into bad. The acting is mostly just serviceable, the production value looks cheap the fights, you know the fights? The one thing a battle focused manga/anime is counting on to always be intense, emotional and impactful, yeah they suck. The Mihawk v Zoro fight actually made me laugh it looked so bad, I laughed out loud at a scene that made me cry for days when I thought about it after seeing it in the anime... it just doesn't measure up. It has none of the feeling that made One Piece one of favourite anime ever. The Goodbye between Zeff and Sanji, I cringed when again I should have been fighting back tears. It was so last second and forced. I didn't actually care about the characters. The kid playing young Sanji was terrible too, the moment when he sees Zeffs leg should have made my chest hurt instead I just stared blankly and felt nothing.

This show is fine, if you haven't seen the anime I think it would be pretty good actually. There's parts that work sure, some of the jokes are better, some of the plot even works better because it's not stretched out. But where it counts the most it unfortunately doesn't work...",02-Sep-23,4.0,dont understand see many reviews giving stars think happening fans watching show relieved isnt completely butchering animemanga theyre kind awestruck pay much attention pay way attention necessary enjoy something show fine one thing well doesnt completely change plot characters meaning original work thats everything else though mid leaning bad acting mostly serviceable production value looks cheap fights know fights one thing battle focused mangaanime counting always intense emotional impactful yeah suck mihawk v zoro fight actually made laugh looked bad laughed loud scene made cry days thought seeing anime doesnt measure none feeling made one piece one favourite anime ever goodbye zeff sanji cringed fighting back tears last second forced didnt actually care characters kid playing young sanji terrible moment sees zeffs leg made chest hurt instead stared blankly felt nothing show fine havent seen anime think would pretty good actually theres parts work sure jokes better plot even works better stretched counts unfortunately doesnt work
Onepice all time best,"When it was announced that the beloved ""One Piece"" anime and manga series would be receiving the live-action treatment, fans around the world held their breath in anticipation and a bit of trepidation. Adapting a sprawling, epic tale like ""One Piece"" into a live-action format is no small feat. After watching the live-action movie adaptation, I can confidently say that it was a grand adventure on the silver screen, capturing the essence of what makes ""One Piece"" so special.

**Faithful to the Source Material**

One of the biggest concerns for fans was whether the live-action adaptation would stay true to the source material. I'm pleased to report that it does, and it does so with remarkable attention to detail. From the moment the film begins, it immerses you in the world of ""One Piece."" The Straw Hat crew, led by the indomitable Monkey D. Luffy, is faithfully recreated, from their distinct personalities to their iconic looks. It's clear that the filmmakers took great care in honoring Eiichiro Oda's original vision.

**Casting and Characterization**

The casting choices for the Straw Hat crew are spot-on. Luffy, portrayed by [Actor's Name], embodies the boundless enthusiasm and determination of the character. [Actor's Name] captures the essence of Luffy's carefree yet unyielding nature, making him a joy to watch.

The rest of the crew, from Zoro to Nami, Sanji to Usopp, are equally well-cast. Each actor brings their unique charm to their respective roles, and it's evident that they put in the effort to understand and embody their characters. Special mention should go to [Actor's Name] as Captain Smoker, who brings a commanding presence to the role.

**Visual Effects and World-Building**

""One Piece"" is known for its vast and imaginative world, and the live-action adaptation spares no expense in bringing this world to life. The visual effects are nothing short of spectacular. From the bustling streets of Water 7 to the eerie, mist-covered Thriller Bark, every location feels authentic and true to the source material.

The use of CGI for the various Devil Fruit abilities is particularly impressive. Luffy's Gum-Gum powers, for example, look fantastic and are seamlessly integrated into the action sequences. The attention to detail in recreating iconic scenes from the anime and manga, such as Luffy's battle against Crocodile or the Going Merry's Viking funeral, will undoubtedly thrill fans.

**Plot and Pacing**

Adapting a long-running series like ""One Piece"" into a single movie means making some tough choices about what to include and what to leave out. The film wisely focuses on a single story arc, in this case, the Alabasta Arc. This allows for a coherent and engaging narrative that doesn't feel rushed or overloaded with information.

The pacing is well-balanced, with a mix of action, character development, and humor. It captures the essence of what makes ""One Piece"" so enjoyable - the camaraderie of the Straw Hat crew, their unwavering resolve in the face of adversity, and their knack for finding trouble wherever they go.

**Action Sequences and Choreography**

""One Piece"" is known for its epic battles, and the live-action adaptation delivers in spades. The action sequences are a highlight of the film, choreographed with precision and flair. Whether it's Luffy going toe-to-toe with Crocodile or Zoro unleashing his three-sword style, the fights are a visual treat.

The film doesn't shy away from the supernatural elements of ""One Piece."" Devil Fruit powers are showcased in all their glory, adding an extra layer of excitement to the battles. The climactic showdown in Alabasta is a pulse-pounding spectacle that will have you on the edge of your seat.

**Themes and Character Development**

At its core, ""One Piece"" is a story about dreams, friendship, and the pursuit of freedom. The live-action adaptation captures these themes beautifully. It delves.",01-Sep-23,10.0,announced beloved one piece anime manga series would receiving liveaction treatment fans around world held breath anticipation bit trepidation adapting sprawling epic tale like one piece liveaction format small feat watching liveaction movie adaptation confidently say grand adventure silver screen capturing essence makes one piece special faithful source material one biggest concerns fans whether liveaction adaptation would stay true source material im pleased report remarkable attention detail moment film begins immerses world one piece straw hat crew led indomitable monkey luffy faithfully recreated distinct personalities iconic looks clear filmmakers took great care honoring eiichiro odas original vision casting characterization casting choices straw hat crew spoton luffy portrayed actors name embodies boundless enthusiasm determination character actors name captures essence luffys carefree yet unyielding nature making joy watch rest crew zoro nami sanji usopp equally wellcast actor brings unique charm respective roles evident put effort understand embody characters special mention go actors name captain smoker brings commanding presence role visual effects worldbuilding one piece known vast imaginative world liveaction adaptation spares expense bringing world life visual effects nothing short spectacular bustling streets water eerie mistcovered thriller bark every location feels authentic true source material use cgi various devil fruit abilities particularly impressive luffys gumgum powers example look fantastic seamlessly integrated action sequences attention detail recreating iconic scenes anime manga luffys battle crocodile going merrys viking funeral undoubtedly thrill fans plot pacing adapting longrunning series like one piece single movie means making tough choices include leave film wisely focuses single story arc case alabasta arc allows coherent engaging narrative doesnt feel rushed overloaded information pacing wellbalanced mix action character development humor captures essence makes one piece enjoyable camaraderie straw hat crew unwavering resolve face adversity knack finding trouble wherever go action sequences choreography one piece known epic battles liveaction adaptation delivers spades action sequences highlight film choreographed precision flair whether luffy going toetotoe crocodile zoro unleashing threesword style fights visual treat film doesnt shy away supernatural elements one piece devil fruit powers showcased glory adding extra layer excitement battles climactic showdown alabasta pulsepounding spectacle edge seat themes character development core one piece story dreams friendship pursuit freedom liveaction adaptation captures themes beautifully delves
The series had EIGHT episodes!,"The series had EIGHT episodes! I was expecting more and there should have been more with the quality and efforts they put into it. At least the standard 13 episodes to flesh out some of the storylines even more. They had to exclude Luffy vs Don Krieg which was one of the highlights of the East Blue Saga. Overall, OPLA is a solid 9/10 for me. The straw hats were perfectly cast and so were some of the supporting cast, like Koby, Helmeppo, Red Leg Zeff, Kuina, Garp and Mihawk.

I hope this series gets renewed for many more seasons with more episodes each season.

Really fantastic,"Absolutely amazing. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. It's even better than the anime, please anime lovers don't be angry. The character development is tremendous. They're not running for the story, that's cool. It details all the characters and allows you to bond with them all.

The soundtrack is already epic, but it's even better here. The music during the events fully supports the stage and emotions. The art direction, the decorations, the costumes are magnificent. Every single effect is flawless, none of them look wrong. Why only 8 episodes? How can I wait one year for the next season?!!!!!",07-Sep-23,10.0,absolutely amazing made laugh cry time even better anime please anime lovers dont angry character development tremendous theyre running story thats cool details characters allows bond soundtrack already epic even better music events fully supports stage emotions art direction decorations costumes magnificent every single effect flawless none look wrong episodes wait one year next season
Excellent adaptation,"The actors in the series embody their characters perfectly and capture the essence of One Piece. Morgan Davies as Koby shines especially bright. The show features classic scenes from the anime, as well as fresh ideas that keep things moving at a TV series pace. It's perfect for both longtime fans and newcomers.

I was so captivated by the show that I watched an entire season in just two days. The production quality, costumes, and special effects all combine to make this series one of the most enjoyable of the year.

I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great show to watch.

With a 1000+ episode anime and thousands of storylines and lore built in over 20 years Netflix had quite the task but they knew to bet on the right horse and it clearly paid off the CGI is breathtaking and it was no easy task taking the world of one piece and making it live action, hats off to Netflix for the one.",01-Sep-23,10.0,date canon story say truly faithful yet unique take anime adaptation sticking directly source material remaking freme frame adding small details added learnt years one piece anime episode anime thousands storylines lore built years netflix quite task knew bet right horse clearly paid cgi breathtaking easy task taking world one piece making live action hats netflix one
Finally people who never gave animes a chance will get what they were missing,"It doesn't matter how the story is told, be it via book, audio, anime or live action; the story is what matters most and the One Piece story is amazing. Friendship, bravery, loyalty, self sacrifice, believing in and chasing your dreams.

As a fan of the anime, I only glanced at the trailer to avoid spoilers but that little production documentary about how much effort went into creating the ships, costumes, overall set and the spirit of the cast for Luffy (I√±aki Godoy) and how passionate he seemed to be about the series left me pretty confident that it would be a great first season and I wasn't disappointed. Despite some minor fx issues and the look of the fish men, I loved the first season.

This is better then what I expected,"I thought it would be just like any other live action but this one OMG, am a one piece fan and this live action won my heart it's absolutely amazing with little modification to the story. In the original some arcs are very very long and boring but that dosent seem to be the problem in the live action as the creators have shortened the story but cutting some thing off and that makes this better like at the baratie in the original don kreig battles Luffy and then mihalk intervines and then Zoro and mihalk fight for like 6episodes but that has been cut in the live action don krieg dosent get to fight Luffy and Zoro battle with mihalk also is as fasanari g as it was just shortened and that's what I like.

Writing sucks,"The design, characters and everything looks good, but the writing sucks so bad. I don't feel a lot of emotions watching this. Which I think it's an essential part of the show. They took out:
the part where the mayor and the dog tries to save a house before Buggy burned it down
the devastation of how Kaya turned away from Usopp.



even the backstory of Luffy where Shanks lost his hands didn't feel as impactful.


And more and more.

People talk too much and there's no substance to it Just bad writing. I wish they hired better writers.

I love the way everything look though, but if they don't improve the writing, it is just gonna look like a fan made show, which it is now.",02-Sep-23,1.0,design characters everything looks good writing sucks bad dont feel lot emotions watching think essential part show took part mayor dog tries save house buggy burned devastation kaya turned away usopp even backstory luffy shanks lost hands didnt feel impactful people talk much theres substance bad writing wish hired better writers love way everything look though dont improve writing gonna look like fan made show

I would say its a pretty good show to watch very addicting, even though i know everything thats going to happen as anime watcher, it was still very cool to rewatch those parts in live action. Would I reccommend this to new and anime watchers? YES 100% its very addicting and fun to watch. Are their cringy moments if you are a anime watcher? Yes but the made it into a way that it is funny or you forget about it. New viewers i would also reccommend because it can be a good intro into getting into the anime.

Great to watch film,"The One Piece Netflix live-action series is a mixed bag. On the one hand, it has a great cast of actors who bring the Straw Hat Pirates to life. Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, and Jacob Romero Gibson as Usopp are all standouts, and they have great chemistry together. The series also does a good job of capturing the humor and heart of the source material.

On the other hand, the series struggles to translate the anime's over-the-top action and visuals to live-action. The fight scenes are often clunky and unconvincing, and the special effects are subpar. The series also takes some liberties with the source material, which may not sit well with fans.

Overall, the One Piece Netflix live-action series is a serviceable adaptation that is worth a watch for fans of the anime. However, it is not without its flaws, and it may not be to everyone's taste.",01-Sep-23,8.0,one piece netflix liveaction series mixed bag one hand great cast actors bring straw hat pirates life mackenyu roronoa zoro emily rudd nami jacob romero gibson usopp standouts great chemistry together series also good job capturing humor heart source material hand series struggles translate animes overthetop action visuals liveaction fight scenes often clunky unconvincing special effects subpar series also takes liberties source material may sit well fans overall one piece netflix liveaction series serviceable adaptation worth watch fans anime however without flaws may everyones taste

An open door.,"Finally something creative and just fun to watch. I know nothing about One Piece other than the fact that people who watch the Anime and read the Manga love it. The only bad thing I've heard about One Piece is the commitment to get into it now is insane. To me its a world i was always interested in but i couldn't commit the time to taking a deep dive.

My brain lives in a ton of worlds including the one i'm trying to create and the though of another one is especially one this large is exhausting. Some of the reviews i've seen about the live action show seem to ask Why make it? There is no need for a live action version. It couldn't possibly add anything to the already deep and well flushed out story. I think the answer to that is Why not. In a world where everything is recreated and adapted to live action why not take the ones on the highest pedestals and give it a shot. Unfortunately most of the shots miss take your pick but in the case of One Piece I think it hit. The story was great. The cast was diverse without shoving it down our throats. Every character has their time to shine. The use of Practical effects and CGI was well balanced and the music fit well.

If this was based off of nothing that was ever heard of it would be a hit. This is an open door to the people who want to walk into this world and i would recommend you do because there is nothing like it. It is absolutely original ,silly, action packed and surprisingly heartwarming. In my opinion its the best show that came out this year so far based on the fact that i was upset that there were only 8 episodes. One Piece is just plain fun.",01-Sep-23,9.0,finally something creative fun watch know nothing one piece fact people watch anime read manga love bad thing ive heard one piece commitment get insane world always interested couldnt commit time taking deep dive brain lives ton worlds including one im trying create though another one especially one large exhausting reviews ive seen live action show seem ask make need live action version couldnt possibly add anything already deep well flushed story think answer world everything recreated adapted live action take ones highest pedestals give shot unfortunately shots miss take pick case one piece think hit story great cast diverse without shoving throats every character time shine use practical effects cgi well balanced music fit well based nothing ever heard would hit open door people want walk world would recommend nothing like absolutely original silly action packed surprisingly heartwarming opinion best show came year far based fact upset episodes one piece plain fun
Sadly I rejected the anime,"Wicked good show bub!! Action adventure human emotions are not out of the question pulling on heart strings with everyone's back story. You get a feeling for the good guys and the bad guys. The back and forth is quirky. Directing and filming catches the anime feel with lens in face and acting, is not overreaching for the character feels. Makes you fall in love with the show one character at a time. One piece will make you yearn for more once you reach the 7th episode knowing it's going end and having to wait another year to watch the next season.

The curse is broken,"Finally an anime adaptation done well. Perfectly encapsulates the wacky, goofy, fun vibe of the series without getting too cringy. There were some changes to the original story, but for the sake condensing the saga into 8 episodes and cutting out some of the chaff for newcomers to the world of One Piece it was done very well. Nothing was jeopardized with how the story was restructured. The actors embodied the characters I've grown to love over the years to near perfection. Some og the visual effects were incredible, but despite the massive budget, some of the CGI was a bit sketchy to downright bad. Thankfully the story and acting outweighs the visual effects by a mile. It was a fun watch and has me ready/ hoping for a second season.",05-Sep-23,9.0,finally anime adaptation done well perfectly encapsulates wacky goofy fun vibe series without getting cringy changes original story sake condensing saga episodes cutting chaff newcomers world one piece done well nothing jeopardized story restructured actors embodied characters ive grown love years near perfection og visual effects incredible despite massive budget cgi bit sketchy downright bad thankfully story acting outweighs visual effects mile fun watch ready hoping second season
Great Adaptation For Everybody,"One Piece is a manga I've been following for a long time, so I was eagerly anticipating its series. After watching it, I was quite surprised because they did things I didn't expect, but in a good way. This series really appeals to everyone. Even if I had never watched One Piece before, I would still like it because despite all the absurdity, it gives off the vibe of a real tv series, not a live action. Right now, the only question on my mind is how they will continue such a long series. But I'm sure that the people who did such a good job in the first season can overcome this challenge as well.",15-Sep-23,9.0,one piece manga ive following long time eagerly anticipating series watching quite surprised things didnt expect good way series really appeals everyone even never watched one piece would still like despite absurdity gives vibe real tv series live action right question mind continue long series im sure people good job first season overcome challenge well
A very honest review and a very one-sided beef with Quina,"To be completely honest I think it's an absolute masterpiece of a series and you can clearly Odas touches and the vision behind this masterpiece of a series. HOWEVER I absolutely hated ,and I really cannot stress this enough, kuinas role in the series (absolute no hate towards the actress). I also didn't enjoy the whole flashback with zoro, I feel like it lost most of the actual sentiment of why zoro chose to become who he is.

On another note I do think that it had great casting, a very fulfilling and intriguing storyline that didn't really stray from the original (Luffy has been nothing less than an absolute joy to witness starting his adventure).

Every single thing has been done in an excellent manner ,such as the costumes , the ships , even the cgi used for the manifestation of the devil fruit powers has been done in a very realistic way and in a way that doesn't make it seem forced and fake .

ALSO The ""villains"" have been in my opinion one the shows biggest show stealers , every single one of them have given spectacular performances and truly made everything feel the right amount of creepy and nerve racking .

Finally the ""straw hats"" gave incredible performances and although its extremely weird to watch a live action adaptation they did have a certain familiarity to them that made watching the series very pleasant . (Again the actor who plays luffy is an absolute sweetheart and makes the experience all the more worthwhile) So to finish up the only that bothered me the most has to have been Quinas Character which to be completely honest in the grant scheme of things is not all that big and probably its also not that deep , but did get on my nerves enough to want to rant about it . Given that her character in the anime has been an absolute sweetheart and a 10/10 I did feel the need to just get it out of me.

The series in all aspects and factors is amazingly done , in a very careful and meticulous manner, has absolute incredible delivery by every single one of the actors and if you watch it without bias you absolutely in for a joy ride .",02-Sep-23,10.0,completely honest think absolute masterpiece series clearly odas touches vision behind masterpiece series however absolutely hated really cannot stress enough kuinas role series absolute hate towards actress also didnt enjoy whole flashback zoro feel like lost actual sentiment zoro chose become another note think great casting fulfilling intriguing storyline didnt really stray original luffy nothing less absolute joy witness starting adventure every single thing done excellent manner costumes ships even cgi used manifestation devil fruit powers done realistic way way doesnt make seem forced fake also villains opinion one shows biggest show stealers every single one given spectacular performances truly made everything feel right amount creepy nerve racking finally straw hats gave incredible performances although extremely weird watch live action adaptation certain familiarity made watching series pleasant actor plays luffy absolute sweetheart makes experience worthwhile finish bothered quinas character completely honest grant scheme things big probably also deep get nerves enough want rant given character anime absolute sweetheart feel need get series aspects factors amazingly done careful meticulous manner absolute incredible delivery every single one actors watch without bias absolutely joy ride
A Fair Attempt with Flat Emotions and Missing Charm,"Having watched and loved the anime, I was'nt able to stop comparing it. I have to admin that it was a fair attempt to adapt it to live action, and the actors had a gruesom job to do, but the negatives got my focus quite much: -The emotions that you get are almost flat -The music score did not help -The acting and the dialogues were quite cringy and nothing like one piece -I understand that you cannot take much time for each episode like in the anime/manga, but so many strong details from the script were taken out, that it lost a vital part of its charm.. Some characters were so flat like Bellemere.

Speechless! We need a Season 2.,"I have been eagerly awaiting the release of the One Piece Live Action Series, and I must say, I am impressed. The series has managed to capture the essence of the beloved anime and manga that I have grown to love over the years.

The attention to detail in the production design and costume is remarkable. The world of One Piece feels alive and vibrant, with the iconic locations and characters faithfully brought to life on the screen. The casting choices have been spot-on, with the actors embodying the spirit and personality of the characters I know so well.

One of the things that impressed me the most is the way the series balances the humor, action, and emotional depth that made the original story so compelling. The writing stays true to the heart of the source material, while also adding some fresh twists and surprises that keep fans like me engaged and excited to see what happens next.

The visual effects and action sequences are well-executed, showcasing the epic battles and powers of the Devil Fruit users in a way that feels authentic to the series. The attention to detail in recreating the iconic moves and powers of the characters is commendable.

While no adaptation can fully capture every aspect of a long-running and complex story like One Piece, the Netflix series does justice to the source material. It pays homage to the original while also adding its own unique flavor, making it an enjoyable watch for both longtime fans and newcomers to the franchise.

Overall, as a fan, I am thrilled with the new One Piece Live Action Series. It brings the world of One Piece to life in a way that honors the original while also standing on its own merits. I am excited to continue watching and see where the series takes us on this grand adventure.",02-Sep-23,10.0,eagerly awaiting release one piece live action series must say impressed series managed capture essence beloved anime manga grown love years attention detail production design costume remarkable world one piece feels alive vibrant iconic locations characters faithfully brought life screen casting choices spoton actors embodying spirit personality characters know well one things impressed way series balances humor action emotional depth made original story compelling writing stays true heart source material also adding fresh twists surprises keep fans like engaged excited see happens next visual effects action sequences wellexecuted showcasing epic battles powers devil fruit users way feels authentic series attention detail recreating iconic moves powers characters commendable adaptation fully capture every aspect longrunning complex story like one piece netflix series justice source material pays homage original also adding unique flavor making enjoyable watch longtime fans newcomers franchise overall fan thrilled new one piece live action series brings world one piece life way honors original also standing merits excited continue watching see series takes us grand adventure
A show for everyone! Rooting for a second season,"I've been a fan of One Piece for a while now, I read the manga and watched the anime.

I had low-expectations for a live-action but, oh my, I was wrong!

This is an incredible introduction to the One Piece world, it has all the key moments and even if there were some story changes they resulted in an incredible TV adaptation.

The cast, the OST and the pacing are just right.

A big shoutout to the actors who interpret Mihawk, Kuro and Buggy, their performance is truly outstanding!

It is a light-hearted show that talks about freedom, friendship, and dreams, which let you get in touch with your inner-child, making it a show for literally all ages!

The reason why I give it a 9 instead of a 10 is the quality of some special effects which may seem a bit underwhelming and for a few interactions between some characters which sound a bit ""fake"" and ""forced"" (Marvel-style of cringe interactions).

Long Time Fan - 10 Stars!,"Amazing! As a long time watcher, I never thought I'd get the experience to watch One Piece from scratch again with the same excitement. This gives me that excitement. Well done to the entire cast and team.

The CGI is done very intelligently, especially with Luffy's devil fruit, focussing on it at the correct times to give the look and feel without it feeling weird.

The cast is absolutely phenomenal, I wasn't sure of some of the choices at the beginning but they were obviously focused on finding personality fit compared to looks and that holds up throughout the show.

I hope these actors are ready for a long stint on TV because if they production team and writers keep it up, they have many more seasons on the horizon!

"Costume, Hair and Make-Up could be better","I thought casting was off because the characters felt like they lacked some authenticity but after seeing the actors interviews their energies actually very much fit their respective characters. I think it was the costume, hair and makeup that could have made it even better, it's not bad but not quite there yet imo. Like Nami's wig looks really cheap... it also does not work with the eyebrows. The actress without costume is actually more Nami like... Zoro is made too pretty, and is giving boyband vibes. Proportion of Luffy's straw hat could be slightly bigger and it's sitting too low and too close to the actor's eyes. Usopp does not have enough details and is looking flat. Sanji's lacking that loose playboy energy in his formal look. Like the choice of neck tie and the shirt quality and the way it's buttoned up all matters. He now looks like Wall Street banker.

Anyway overall very good still just thought compare to the sophistication in the visual effect and set design the character appearances were falling short.",01-Sep-23,8.0,thought casting characters felt like lacked authenticity seeing actors interviews energies actually much fit respective characters think costume hair makeup could made even better bad quite yet imo like namis wig looks really cheap also work eyebrows actress without costume actually nami like zoro made pretty giving boyband vibes proportion luffys straw hat could slightly bigger sitting low close actors eyes usopp enough details looking flat sanjis lacking loose playboy energy formal look like choice neck tie shirt quality way buttoned matters looks like wall street banker anyway overall good still thought compare sophistication visual effect set design character appearances falling short
Gomu Gomu nooooo.....Sucks!,I don't have anything with the actors they did the best they had with the script. But the script is not one piece. One piece is supposed to be fun with stupid little (insulting) jokes and adventure and the nakamas on the trip. If they want to do this they should keep it as close as they can to the manga. Mr 7 looks nothing like the manga and anime. Garp is not like they are showing we onlynsee garp serious in the Marineford in the war of the best. Where is Ussop's nose? Literally his whole identity and funny thing about him. Roger was not afraid of dieing he was smilling. The map was stolen by Buggy. Luffy and Nami stole the map from Buggy. And I would have preferred to at least instead of hearing gum gum pistol. To hear Gomu Gomu no Pistol. The Japanese pronunciation of the attacks are much better than the one in English.

"A big step forward for live action anime adaptations, but as a huge fan left me wanting.","In general there's a lot of positives to this adaptation. The casting is amazing. The sets look great. The music captures the feel of the original. As a whole it captures the pure essence of One Piece and what makes it so special. However, there are many honestly baffling changes to characters and storylines. Buggy being my main complaint. The original character for Buggy is somewhat threatening at first but is still very goofy and hard to take seriously. The live action removes this entirely making him more of a Joker-like character that I personally find irritating. For the storyline, most changes made were made with the obvious intentions to make it feel less episodic and flow more naturally from arc to arc. However, in order to accomplish that they have made the villains from separate arcs interact with each other in ways that feel unnatural and kind of spoil the fun of seeing characters return after a long period of time. The dialogue as well for the crew is awkward at times. For example, Zoro is much more antagonistic and edgy that he is in the original and it makes him much less likeable. For new fans, this will be enjoyable. Some old fans might love it as well, but I personally feel that it was fine, but at times misses the point or pushes things on too strongly.",04-Sep-23,7.0,general theres lot positives adaptation casting amazing sets look great music captures feel original whole captures pure essence one piece makes special however many honestly baffling changes characters storylines buggy main complaint original character buggy somewhat threatening first still goofy hard take seriously live action removes entirely making jokerlike character personally find irritating storyline changes made made obvious intentions make feel less episodic flow naturally arc arc however order accomplish made villains separate arcs interact ways feel unnatural kind spoil fun seeing characters return long period time dialogue well crew awkward times example zoro much antagonistic edgy original makes much less likeable new fans enjoyable old fans might love well personally feel fine times misses point pushes things strongly

compared to the animated version,"If we attempt to explain this in terms of film styles, we can consider the animated version as formalistic, typically filled with a personal artistic style. However, faithfully replicating the animated style in a live-action film might make the overall feel awkward and the production more challenging and expensive. Therefore, the director opted for a more classical style closer to real-life. Films in the classical style are often seen as a middle ground, avoiding extreme forms or excessive realism. This way, the audience can experience the imaginative world of One Piece while also feeling the emotions of the real world. Viewers find it easier to resonate with more lifelike visuals.

Regarding transitions in the film, I'd like to highlight the director's extensive use of visual match cuts, connecting two unrelated scenes seamlessly. For instance, in the third act, Zoro angrily throws down a wanted poster of Buggy the Clown, shouting, ""You idiot, Buggy!"" The camera focuses on the wanted poster, and the scene smoothly transitions to a distant one involving Buggy the Clown. This technique showcases the director's careful handling of One Piece's intricate subplots.

Of course, the live-action film is not without its flaws. It sacrifices some of the exaggerated scenes and special effects found in the animated version, especially in the action sequences. Audiences may not fully experience the adrenaline-pumping fight scenes seen in the animated version, and some fight sequences have been simplified, which is somewhat disappointing. However, this can be understood as an effort to maintain balance in the live-action adaptation, avoiding excessive imitation of the animated version and resulting in noticeable inconsistencies. Overall, the live-action film remains a highly commendable work.

Nothing like anime,"Although it is trying really hard to copy the storyline of anime, the most important thing that I think they did not do is that the whole show feels very dark and even serious tone , however Pnepiece in anime is so bright and funny. The anime's cruical Moments have impact because it connect and this show is so dull the high point like Nami stabbing her tattoo is totally a miss.

Koby character is ruined in this with many others.

To give credit to the show the CGI effects are great, it actually feels very real.

Overall I think the anime fans will hate it because it does not do the justice with the whole vibe of anime. Also one big issue with this is that most part show is in dark environment or either night scene. This makes it unnecessarily dark and serious.",31-Aug-23,2.0,although trying really hard copy storyline anime important thing think whole show feels dark even serious tone however pnepiece anime bright funny animes cruical moments impact connect show dull high point like nami stabbing tattoo totally miss koby character ruined many others give credit show cgi effects great actually feels real overall think anime fans hate justice whole vibe anime also one big issue part show dark environment either night scene makes unnecessarily dark serious
They did their best... but unfortunately it can't compete with the anime,"Many people were worried about the cg. Some were worried about the cast. From the promotional videos, I could already tell they were great. That wasn't the problem.

When the show is so heavily condensed into just a few hours, even some parts that I felt were somewhat important were left out, it really changes the effectiveness of the emotional scenes. Maybe it's also because I know the story but even the Nami crying scene didn't have much impact on me.

They certainly did the best one could possibly imagine based on the constraints but it's different and a tad bit inferior.

The vibe of the show being realistic is also different. The comedy and lively atmosphere that one would get from reading the manga or anime is not present. Nothing wrong with that. It was probably the right move but it's still important to note.

On the positive side the interactions between the crew though less comedic, felt very believable.

Overall the show was decent. For the full experience, take your time and slowly enjoy the manga.",01-Sep-23,8.0,many people worried cg worried cast promotional videos could already tell great wasnt problem show heavily condensed hours even parts felt somewhat important left really changes effectiveness emotional scenes maybe also know story even nami crying scene didnt much impact certainly best one could possibly imagine based constraints different tad bit inferior vibe show realistic also different comedy lively atmosphere one would get reading manga anime present nothing wrong probably right move still important note positive side interactions crew though less comedic felt believable overall show decent full experience take time slowly enjoy manga
Netflix's LIVE ACTION One Piece BREAKS The Cycle,"Live-action anime has always been a slippery slope. It wasn't because it was something nobody wanted but because it was never done well for a long time. This show has broken that streak. It's scary accurate to the original series, from the outfits to the plot points.

One Piece is one of the longest-running anime/manga series ever created. They did the impossible by curating Oda's greatest hits into a cohesive story with mass appeal. It is nothing short of exceptional. I am an avid watcher of the anime. So my favorite part of the show when I first started watching it was all the easter eggs. Knowing what I know about the show so far gave me a new appreciation for the series.

The fighting choreography was elite across the board. I enjoyed Zoro and Mihawk's fight the most. Even the special effects are pretty good. What stood out the most to me was the title cards being a different Jolly Roger based on the episode. The way they incorporated the wanted posters with introducing key characters was fire.

World Building aside, the pacing for this series was surprisingly good. Considering they fit over sixty anime episodes into an 8 episode season. The chemistry between the crew had me worried at first. Each character was able to bring their dynamic to the table. Their synergy was on point as a collective.

Some characters suffered more than others though. Take Luffy for example. His character development did not benefit from this condensed story at all. Granted, it only makes sense that some of these moments were not going to have the same effect they did in the anime. The build-up didn't have enough time to marinate. I won't say that it was bad but, I will say that it was good enough. I can't deny that the drama is what makes One Piece hit different, and this series was missing a little of that. One Piece has always been about chasing your dreams no matter and, they got that point across so it is a win in my book.",01-Oct-23,8.0,liveaction anime always slippery slope wasnt something nobody wanted never done well long time show broken streak scary accurate original series outfits plot points one piece one longestrunning animemanga series ever created impossible curating odas greatest hits cohesive story mass appeal nothing short exceptional avid watcher anime favorite part show first started watching easter eggs knowing know show far gave new appreciation series fighting choreography elite across board enjoyed zoro mihawks fight even special effects pretty good stood title cards different jolly roger based episode way incorporated wanted posters introducing key characters fire world building aside pacing series surprisingly good considering fit sixty anime episodes episode season chemistry crew worried first character able bring dynamic table synergy point collective characters suffered others though take luffy example character development benefit condensed story granted makes sense moments going effect anime buildup didnt enough time marinate wont say bad say good enough cant deny drama makes one piece hit different series missing little one piece always chasing dreams matter got point across win book

The beat adaptation to date.,"I have been watching one piece for over 20. This show has been the most faithful adaptaion of any anime series I have seen. It definitely beats out Death note, Cowboy Bepop and ghost in the Shell for faith full adaptation. It does have a few lines that are said differently but not enough to throw the show out of wack. They could still have been said in the og but not quite as strong. It's a tad rushed but that's what happens when you try to adapt a show this long for regular TV.

This is over my expectation.,"Honestly I didn't expect anything that great about this live action, because I thought probably the budget are low, and (sorry) netflix usually make bad live adaption. But turned out this one is great. CGI okay, cast are great, no famous actors (far as I know) but everyone put their best on their acting and bringing the original character into life. Story are great they didn't ruin the original, they don't change the most important part. I think they listen to the fans and Oda himself and not put their own agenda into this film.

"A slightly better than usual, but still disappointing live-action adaptation","As someone who has become an avid fan of the animated series over the past 2 years, I think this adaptation is fine but often lacks some of the over-the-top spectacle that I really came to enjoy.

The show does a spectacular job of adapting the source material and building the world into a believable and beautiful backdrop for the story. Overall, I think the acting was on par or slightly better than what I was hoping for (although the delivery and dialogue could use some mild revision, but more on that later), and it was so nice to see such a diverse ensemble in every role.

What makes the One Piece anime such an engaging show for me is the blend between super goofy, silly moments contrasted by these moments of intense seriousness. Luffy in the animated series is happy-go-lucky but not because he's just winging it, but because he has the sheer confidence that he is worthy of becoming the King of the Pirates. He doesn't waver in his pursuit of the One Piece--he WILL find it. That confidence is what drives his character through these early arcs in the story. He doesn't waver because in his mind, no setback could possibly deter his end goal, and he is strong enough to achieve it (or will become strong enough by the end).

However, Luffy in the LA does not carry that overwhelming sense of confidence. Happy-go-lucky yes, but confident? Not so much. This is by no means an attack on the performance delivered by I√±aki Godoy as I think he delivers on the way his character is written for the show, yet for future seasons I hope to see some more of the overbearing self-confidence that Luffy brings in the anime as it becomes more pertinent to escalating certain plot points later in the series.

My biggest gripe, however, is I think this show takes itself too seriously. Zoro is serious, Nami is serious, Garp is serious--One Piece is hilarious! Bring in more over-the-top silliness. Be larger than life! Captain Morgan has an axe for a hand and a metal jaw; Buggy has a giant red nose and can split his body into multiple pieces at will; why am I trying to take these villains seriously? They're supposed to be ridiculous! I think leaning into the ridiculousness instead of trying to make them ""grounded"" or ""realistic"" will pay off much more meaningfully especially in later arcs where some of the villains ARE really serious. One Piece has very intense lows, but the only reason that they feel so intense is because a significant portion of the story is so lighthearted and goofy. But overall, I feel that the live action falls a little emotionally flat.

While this show is leaps and bounds ahead of many other live action adaptations, I still have trouble recommending this as a good series on its own. I think that season 1 indicates that the directors, writers, and actors have some work to do to figure out exactly what the identity of the series is.",04-Sep-23,5.0,someone become avid fan animated series past years think adaptation fine often lacks overthetop spectacle really came enjoy show spectacular job adapting source material building world believable beautiful backdrop story overall think acting par slightly better hoping although delivery dialogue could use mild revision later nice see diverse ensemble every role makes one piece anime engaging show blend super goofy silly moments contrasted moments intense seriousness luffy animated series happygolucky hes winging sheer confidence worthy becoming king pirates doesnt waver pursuit one piecehe find confidence drives character early arcs story doesnt waver mind setback could possibly deter end goal strong enough achieve become strong enough end however luffy la carry overwhelming sense confidence happygolucky yes confident much means attack performance delivered iaki godoy think delivers way character written show yet future seasons hope see overbearing selfconfidence luffy brings anime becomes pertinent escalating certain plot points later series biggest gripe however think show takes seriously zoro serious nami serious garp seriousone piece hilarious bring overthetop silliness larger life captain morgan axe hand metal jaw buggy giant red nose split body multiple pieces trying take villains seriously theyre supposed ridiculous think leaning ridiculousness instead trying make grounded realistic pay much meaningfully especially later arcs villains really serious one piece intense lows reason feel intense significant portion story lighthearted goofy overall feel live action falls little emotionally flat show leaps bounds ahead many live action adaptations still trouble recommending good series think season indicates directors writers actors work figure exactly identity series
It could have been worse,"The anime is so much better than the series that netflix created.

Story line --- is the same yet, there is a difference in the details which can be annoying.

Acting --- The actor who plays luffys role it was not the best choice. He does look alike but he is not convincing. Generally the chosen actors are good and their acting is ok.

Graphics--- Overall the graphics are good but not all scenes/attacks can be brought to reality. Especially, next seasons will be even more challenging.

Rating--- I am giving 6 stars because i can not give less knowing the actual story line and what it actually represents.

I just dont understand how anyone can think this is good.,Acting was terrible. Just a bunch of B rated actors doing cosplay. I had to constantly rewind because i couldnt get sucked into the show due to the terrible acting. The only scene where I was captivated by the show is young Sanji and owner Zeff. That little kid had better acting experience than the the entire cast. Im sorry if the truth hurts but i guarantee that if you rewatch this series you will understand what im talking about. I really wanted this to be good and it could of been if they found better actors. Every actor is unrecognized and new so they are all over acting doing their own thing. There was no chemistry between the actors what so ever.

One Piece is the hardest anime to adapt into live action but IT BREAKS THE L.A. CURSE!,"I watched it from 3pm to 10:30pm here in the Philippines and I can say it's hella good. üò≠üíó

There are some parts that were skipped which is understandable, but what I like most about it is those parts that they took out did not reroute the story elsewhere (unlike other LA) parts that were skipped are necessary. Example is Don Krieg, that's a good riddance btw.

However, there are also parts that were skipped that are one of the reasons why One Piece is worth watching. An example of this is the backstory of Chouchou, the white dog in Orange town. However Chouchou was shown on the live action when they are bidding the straw hats farewell and I love that.

It's just u know... we all know Luffy will find the one piece at the end but it's their journey and the ""stories"" of people they met along the way that make one piece worth watching until now... but well yeah... it'll take another 20 years if they include all those stories so it's understandable.

But if it's literally u're first time watching One Piece and you love it, i suggest you to start watching the anime. You'll love it even more.

And lastly, the characters Oda chose were ON POINT! Man... they're perfect! (i especially love buggy)

so yeah... overall i love it so much. I'm looking forward to the second season and more season to come.",31-Aug-23,10.0,watched pm pm philippines say hella good parts skipped understandable like parts took reroute story elsewhere unlike la parts skipped necessary example krieg thats good riddance btw however also parts skipped one reasons one piece worth watching example backstory chouchou white dog orange town however chouchou shown live action bidding straw hats farewell love u know know luffy find one piece end journey stories people met along way make one piece worth watching well yeah itll take another years include stories understandable literally ure first time watching one piece love suggest start watching anime youll love even lastly characters oda chose point man theyre perfect especially love buggy yeah overall love much im looking forward second season season come
Diving into Nostalgia: A Profound Critique of an Adaptation,"This adaptation stands as a testament to the yearnings of every dedicated adherent of the source material, the manga, encapsulating a distinctive essence while avoiding the pitfall of straying ludicrously far from its origins. Amidst the commendable achievements, a recurring blemish resurfaces - the confounding and needless fixation on altering the ethnic complexion of characters, beft of any coherent rationale. One is left to ponder the persistent fascination with skin color metamorphosis, a practice that Hollywood, seemingly inexorably, clings to in its pursuit of diversity. A perplexing paradox emerges when contemplating the vibrant array of robust and illustrious characters adorned with brown skin in the realm of One Piece. This cinematic rendition conspicuously omits characters, such as Nami's sister, Nojiko, and the enigmatic Lucky Roux, who were initially envisaged in a specific manner.

However, let it be known that this lamentable oversight does not eclipse the overarching excellence exhibited within this opus. It resonates as an artful testament to diligent craftsmanship and palpable affection, akin to a heartfelt epistle addressed both to the ardent fans and to the luminary Eiichiro Oda himself. This symphonic series strikes a harmonious chord, orchestrating a paean of admiration that resounds deeply.",31-Aug-23,10.0,adaptation stands testament yearnings every dedicated adherent source material manga encapsulating distinctive essence avoiding pitfall straying ludicrously far origins amidst commendable achievements recurring blemish resurfaces confounding needless fixation altering ethnic complexion characters beft coherent rationale one left ponder persistent fascination skin color metamorphosis practice hollywood seemingly inexorably clings pursuit diversity perplexing paradox emerges contemplating vibrant array robust illustrious characters adorned brown skin realm one piece cinematic rendition conspicuously omits characters namis sister nojiko enigmatic lucky roux initially envisaged specific manner however let known lamentable oversight eclipse overarching excellence exhibited within opus resonates artful testament diligent craftsmanship palpable affection akin heartfelt epistle addressed ardent fans luminary eiichiro oda symphonic series strikes harmonious chord orchestrating paean admiration resounds deeply
Minkavio,"It's really great, it's true that the choice of actors is very bad, but it really has appropriate and good special effects and the violence is measured and calculated, and it's a characteristic of Gar Gardan that he spent money on the series and didn't waste it. The choice of an actor named Garp is good and I wish they would put more emphasis on Luffy's dialogues to make it sound like Japanese, English means to pronounce English like Japanese. From my point of view, it is really unkind if we want to give a low MDB score because of the actors, because the story is really good, the pace of the story is faster than the anime, and the dubbing is somewhat suitable with great special effects.",01-Sep-23,10.0,really great true choice actors bad really appropriate good special effects violence measured calculated characteristic gar gardan spent money series didnt waste choice actor named garp good wish would put emphasis luffys dialogues make sound like japanese english means pronounce english like japanese point view really unkind want give low mdb score actors story really good pace story faster anime dubbing somewhat suitable great special effects
Just as it should be,"This series was a must-watch, offering a fresh take on a beloved anime and manga. It provided insights into off-camera events like Mihawk's encounter with Don Krieg and Garp contacting Mihawk, which were absent in the anime. Despite its quicker pace, condensing around 80 episodes into 8 episodes, it still captured the essence of the story. Mihawk's portrayal was remarkable, while characters like Nami and Luffy quickly won over the audience.

However, there were some notable differences. Shanks appeared differently, but eventually became a favorite. The iconic scene of Shanks passing down the straw hat to Luffy felt less iconic than in the manga and anime. Garp's legendary status among the Marines wasn't as apparent until the final episode, and Sanji's farewell from Baratie lacked emotional depth.

On the positive side, Mihawk's introduction was outstanding, showcasing his savagery. Coby's character development was noteworthy, among other subtle yet impactful changes.

Looking ahead, there's excitement for another season. Questions arise about how certain elements like the Reverse River and Crocodile's powers will be portrayed. Concerns linger about casting mere humans for characters like Boa Hancock and capturing the legendary presence of Whitebeard while delivering his iconic dialogue about the ""One Piece"" being real.",01-Sep-23,10.0,series mustwatch offering fresh take beloved anime manga provided insights offcamera events like mihawks encounter krieg garp contacting mihawk absent anime despite quicker pace condensing around episodes episodes still captured essence story mihawks portrayal remarkable characters like nami luffy quickly audience however notable differences shanks appeared differently eventually became favorite iconic scene shanks passing straw hat luffy felt less iconic manga anime garps legendary status among marines wasnt apparent final episode sanjis farewell baratie lacked emotional depth positive side mihawks introduction outstanding showcasing savagery cobys character development noteworthy among subtle yet impactful changes looking ahead theres excitement another season questions arise certain elements like reverse river crocodiles powers portrayed concerns linger casting mere humans characters like boa hancock capturing legendary presence whitebeard delivering iconic dialogue one piece real
Disappointing,"There are some positive things. Although it is not perfect the setting is okay, and some of the costumes show at least some effort. In this respect it is of course much better then flops like the live action Dragonball, at least you see that the makers watched the anime.

However, apart from that I did not like it at all, and judging from the first two episodes I do not think that I will keep watching it.

Of course it is hard to transfer the humour of the Anime into a show, and of course you have to shorten and re-write many things, I do not mind that too much. However, this show fails in almos every aspect: the characters are bland and not a single one captures the essence of the Anime character. Luffy could be any wisecracking main character of a typical Netflix production aimed at a target group of 13-16 years old. Nami is a totally different character, Zoro may be the nearest to the original, but writing and dialogue is so laughable.

I think that the actors so far are not really good, but I guess it is hard to shine with this bad script and dialogue that really is miserable. No one talks like that.

This is a very typical, mediocre Netflix production with a bad script and bad timing, and except names, setting and general story it has not much to do with the original.

Perspective of someone who has seen the anime and read the manga,"I would say they have done a pretty good job overall, yes there are a few flaws and story changes which personally i feel would be better if they kept it the same But the character's personality and the casting is as close to perfect as possible.

gold roger speech (as i feel it more more impactful in both anime and manga maybe they should have used the same dialogues)
the power scaling , as a long time watcher and someone who is also up to the date with the manga
It doesnt feel right that nami zoro and luffy look like they doing equally well in combat.

The first Review I Write,"Been watching anime since childhood, Naruto and One Piece really where my anchor during childhood and adolescence and even now at 24 years old.

a very good show,"The live-action adaptation of ""One Piece"" has been a highly anticipated project for fans of the beloved anime and manga series. As someone who has followed the adventures of Monkey D. Luffy and his crew for years, I must say that I find the live-action version truly impressive and enjoyable. In this 500-word review, I will delve into the reasons why I believe the ""One Piece"" live-action adaptation is a must-watch.

First and foremost, the casting choices for the main characters are spot-on. The selection of actors and actresses to portray the Straw Hat Pirates captures the essence of each character brilliantly. When I saw Monkey D. Luffy portrayed by [Actor's Name], I was immediately struck by his energetic and carefree demeanor, which perfectly mirrors the character's personality. The chemistry among the main cast members is evident, making it easy to believe in the deep bonds that exist within the crew.

One of the standout aspects of the ""One Piece"" live-action adaptation is the attention to detail in recreating the vibrant world of the Grand Line. The set design and CGI work are breathtaking, bringing to life the exotic islands, unique creatures, and epic battles that fans have come to love in the source material. The effort put into faithfully adapting the intricate and diverse environments is truly commendable.

Moreover, the costume and makeup departments deserve praise for their work in ensuring that characters look authentic and true to their manga counterparts. From Luffy's iconic straw hat to Zoro's three-sword style and Nami's cartography tattoos, every detail has been meticulously crafted to pay homage to Eiichiro Oda's original designs.

The narrative of ""One Piece"" is notoriously intricate and spans across numerous arcs and adventures. Adapting such a complex storyline into a live-action format is no small feat, yet the writers and directors have managed to strike a balance between staying faithful to the source material and making necessary adjustments for a different medium. The pacing of the story is well-executed, allowing newcomers to the series to follow along while still offering surprises and fresh perspectives for long-time fans.

What sets the ""One Piece"" live-action adaptation apart from other anime adaptations is its commitment to character development. Each member of the Straw Hat crew undergoes personal growth and transformation throughout their journey, and the live-action series explores these character arcs in a meaningful way. The struggles, aspirations, and relationships of the crew members are portrayed with depth and nuance, making it easy for viewers to connect with their individual stories.

The action sequences in the live-action ""One Piece"" are exhilarating and visually stunning. The choreography and special effects used in the battles, Devil Fruit powers, and confrontations with formidable foes are a true spectacle. Whether it's Luffy's Gum-Gum attacks or Zoro's swordsmanship, fans can expect thrilling and faithful renditions of their favorite action scenes.

In conclusion, the ""One Piece"" live-action adaptation has exceeded my expectations as a dedicated fan of the series. The meticulous attention to detail, strong character portrayals, faithful adaptation of the world, and engaging storytelling make it a fantastic addition to the ""One Piece"" franchise. It not only appeals to fans but also has the potential to introduce the epic tale of the Straw Hat Pirates to a new audience. With its captivating storytelling and stunning visuals, the live-action ""One Piece"" is definitely worth watching, and I eagerly anticipate the continuation of this exciting journey on the small screen.",01-Sep-23,10.0,liveaction adaptation one piece highly anticipated project fans beloved anime manga series someone followed adventures monkey luffy crew years must say find liveaction version truly impressive enjoyable word review delve reasons believe one piece liveaction adaptation mustwatch first foremost casting choices main characters spoton selection actors actresses portray straw hat pirates captures essence character brilliantly saw monkey luffy portrayed actors name immediately struck energetic carefree demeanor perfectly mirrors characters personality chemistry among main cast members evident making easy believe deep bonds exist within crew one standout aspects one piece liveaction adaptation attention detail recreating vibrant world grand line set design cgi work breathtaking bringing life exotic islands unique creatures epic battles fans come love source material effort put faithfully adapting intricate diverse environments truly commendable moreover costume makeup departments deserve praise work ensuring characters look authentic true manga counterparts luffys iconic straw hat zoros threesword style namis cartography tattoos every detail meticulously crafted pay homage eiichiro odas original designs narrative one piece notoriously intricate spans across numerous arcs adventures adapting complex storyline liveaction format small feat yet writers directors managed strike balance staying faithful source material making necessary adjustments different medium pacing story wellexecuted allowing newcomers series follow along still offering surprises fresh perspectives longtime fans sets one piece liveaction adaptation apart anime adaptations commitment character development member straw hat crew undergoes personal growth transformation throughout journey liveaction series explores character arcs meaningful way struggles aspirations relationships crew members portrayed depth nuance making easy viewers connect individual stories action sequences liveaction one piece exhilarating visually stunning choreography special effects used battles devil fruit powers confrontations formidable foes true spectacle whether luffys gumgum attacks zoros swordsmanship fans expect thrilling faithful renditions favorite action scenes conclusion one piece liveaction adaptation exceeded expectations dedicated fan series meticulous attention detail strong character portrayals faithful adaptation world engaging storytelling make fantastic addition one piece franchise appeals fans also potential introduce epic tale straw hat pirates new audience captivating storytelling stunning visuals liveaction one piece definitely worth watching eagerly anticipate continuation exciting journey small screen
A good adaption but got many flaws,So first of all they changed a lot of plot. If some of the viewers end up watching anime or manga they would he like wtf this scene was different in it. Some Characters are introduced way too badly and doesnt capture the vibe. Like garp was supposed to be a jolly old guy who works as a marine and is happy all the time. And they added a garp that gives vibe like smoker or some other serious marine. Buggy fight was too short and didnt even had those iconic gomu gomu no moves. Zoro aint calling his moves like santoryu secret technique sanzen sekai.well its enjoyable and brings those vibes of pirate sea. Its main cast is promising i really liked that zoro and luffy actors. They are on the point. Zoro is the only one whose moves look cool in these tho. Mihawk was just fire. He was on point. To sum up all that its a good one to watch if you have got time cuz its really fun but not comparable to the manga.,04-Sep-23,9.0,first changed lot plot viewers end watching anime manga would like wtf scene different characters introduced way badly doesnt capture vibe like garp supposed jolly old guy works marine happy time added garp gives vibe like smoker serious marine buggy fight short didnt even iconic gomu gomu moves zoro aint calling moves like santoryu secret technique sanzen sekaiwell enjoyable brings vibes pirate sea main cast promising really liked zoro luffy actors point zoro one whose moves look cool tho mihawk fire point sum good one watch got time cuz really fun comparable manga
THE BEST ANIME LIVE ACTION EVER!!!,"Whilst it's not 1 to 1 one with the manga /anime it's still an amazing series, It's a different flavor but it holds the same magic as one-piece. First I want to talk about the actors, All of them did a great job of bringing the characters alive without looking stupid Of course there are still goofy designs but that's not bad it only elevates the show, and all of them appear to have fun with their characters. Now I want to talk about the background, They nailed it. They didn't use ugly CGI for the backgrounds, before watching it I was afraid it would look bad because how can you bring all these unique backgrounds into the real world with CGI?

"Bad Writing, Clunky Actions","I just watched about 350 episodes of the anime. It's a good story, and even in anime, you can feel the scenes, actions, and dialog are great and funny.

But in this adaptation, all of them are gone!

The action and story are weightless, You can't feel the thrill, and I think the story changed for fifth graders. In some scenes is weird, I see a character fall differently from the previous scene. The scenes have no feel to the environment, You can't differentiate if you are in a boat or on land. You can't feel that you are on an adventure with the Star Hat Crews. About 70% of the story is either changed or compressed into meaningless blurps. The costumes are cheap.

Overall it feels like cosplayers trying to create an adaptation, with a very low budget without a script. Maybe they generated the script with Chat GPT3,",04-Sep-23,3.0,watched episodes anime good story even anime feel scenes actions dialog great funny adaptation gone action story weightless cant feel thrill think story changed fifth graders scenes weird see character fall differently previous scene scenes feel environment cant differentiate boat land cant feel adventure star hat crews story either changed compressed meaningless blurps costumes cheap overall feels like cosplayers trying create adaptation low budget without script maybe generated script chat gpt

One of the doubter,"One Piece live-action

I was originally skeptical of the One Piece live-action because the poster looked off and I didn't connect with the characters. But I've been watching One Piece since elementary school, so I was still curious to check it out.

I'm so glad I did! The casting is perfect. The actors look and act great, and they're not annoying. They feel like the real Luffy, Nami, Sanji, Zoro, Usopp, Koby, and Gold Roger. They're my childhood heroes. I love One Piece. And my child is not ruined.

So now, i cant wait to see chopper, Robin, Frankie.

I watched it with my father, who doesn't like this type of entertainment, but when we started to watch he was hooked, which surprisingly pleased him and he liked it!

"Respectful try, but lacks emotion","One Piece is all about emotions. The way Oda delivers this emotional story is unprecedented.

The live action lacks emotion. To be fair, it has some emotion, but I got it only on Sanji backstory and when the sail got the Straw hat at the last episode. This is the only thing they should care. I don't mind cutting story, or CGI not to be great, but you should keep the original dialogue where possible.

Dialogue is so out of the story most of the times, out of character and emotions feel forced. For example Zoro saying ""not a crew"" twice when he is the most loyal from the start. We don't get this loyalty feeling, I didn't cry, I didn't laugh, I didn't feel shocked, I didn't feel righteous... I didn't get goosebumps..

Also story is awkward at times. Maybe for a newcomers perspective it is better. But I don't get some things and why you don't keep the original emotional outcome. I'm gonna list some things.

1. Garp and Marine Koby not part of this storyline. And he is not Garp. Garp is goofy.

2. Saving Zoro. Why do you change the manga great dialogue for some no reason story.

3. Usopp is a model, not Usopp.

4. Nami doesn't give out the berry desire 5. Luffy saying I can't beat you to Arlong 6. The whole Kaya story........ No comments. Also Kaya kissing Usopp.... 7. Buggy interacting with Arlong and the whole story and Arlong been at Baratie... Sorry but find a better way.

8. Garp saying to Koby we don't ask for help and in the next scene calls Mohawk at a Bluetooth Den Den mushi........ 9. Luffy hiding the map at his stomach 10. No real interaction between the crew

Nevertheless it was a good try. Choreography was nice but lacked some impact. Costumes and music nice. Backgrounds were beautiful but in foggy night and interiors scenes that you get so strongly the feeling of a studio and it doesn't give out immersion like game of thrones or similar TV series backgrounds.

Please if this continues just focus on the dialogue, follow the beautiful source material and focus on the emotions.

First successful live action adaptation,"As a longtime fan of the original manga, I started watching with skepticism and reservations, half-expecting another Dragon Ball-level live-action adaptation. However, as I began watching the first episode, my worries turned into anticipation, and anticipation turned into absolute joy. The production company behind the adaptation has succeeded in capturing the essence of the original without straying too far from the source material, avoiding it becoming an unrecognizable monstrosity.

Yes, changes were made to condense the majority of the East Blue saga into 8 episodes. However, all the characters are played by a terrific cast that almost never miss a beat. Get ready to be charmed by the main cast and the ensemble of side characters that this story has to offer. The sets look amazing, bringing a tear to my eye as I watch this world being brought to life.

10/10 Everything You Could Ask For,"An amazing adaption to live action.

I've been a fan of one piece the last 15 years and this show went beyond my expectations. I was actually expecting it to be bad. Well man I was wrong.

Faithful, well written, and well acted.

Best live action adaptation of an anime.

And it isn't close.

It is the type of show that could make One Piece even more mainstream than it already is. My wife (who had trouble getting into the anime) loved this show.

The cast give their own unique takes on the characters in such special ways. It truly enhanced the show and brought the vision of Oda to life.

You truly could not reasonably, as a sane human being, wish for much better.

How I went from sceptical to big fan of the series,"I initially had my doubts about the live action adaptation of One Piece, as such adaptations often end up being disappointing. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality delivered in this series, and it definitely deserves a 10/10 for a anime live action! The casting choices were excellent, with the characters resembling their anime counterparts both in appearance and personality. The overall storyline was preserved, but with better pacing compared to the anime. Unnecessary scenes that don't contribute to the series' progression were wisely excluded. This is crucial considering the original anime has over 1000 episodes, which requires some condensing. Furthermore, the show successfully retained the humor and goofiness that make One Piece so enjoyable. It remained true to the anime on multiple aspects. The One Piece live action showed how to create a successful anime adaptation by respecting both the original anime and the fans. It is worth mentioning that the mangaka, Oda, had supervisory involvement in the production. With all these ingredients combined, the result is a trending Netflix series that sits at number one in over 84 different countries, setting world records in the process. One Piece has broken the curse of live action adaptations, and I hope it inspires others on how to create successful adaptations. This success not only benefits One Piece fans but the entire anime community.""",03-Sep-23,10.0,initially doubts live action adaptation one piece adaptations often end disappointing however pleasantly surprised quality delivered series definitely deserves anime live action casting choices excellent characters resembling anime counterparts appearance personality overall storyline preserved better pacing compared anime unnecessary scenes dont contribute series progression wisely excluded crucial considering original anime episodes requires condensing furthermore show successfully retained humor goofiness make one piece enjoyable remained true anime multiple aspects one piece live action showed create successful anime adaptation respecting original anime fans worth mentioning mangaka oda supervisory involvement production ingredients combined result trending netflix series sits number one different countries setting world records process one piece broken curse live action adaptations hope inspires others create successful adaptations success benefits one piece fans entire anime community
The best manga adaptation,"Yeah it's the best manga adaptation ever.

But it doesn't serve a 10 imo. It lacks a lot of the manga's original humor. The story is also a bit different and not as good as the original.

Some characters diverge from the manga. Garp, for exemple, is not the laid back, always laughing, grandpa bear he is in the manga.

The fights, wich are the highlights of the manga, are suite boring.

The way Luffy gathers his crew doesn't feel as natural as it does in the manga.

I think some longtime fans of the manga (like me) will be a little bit disapointed, but it's still a nice watch, and it's only the first season, let's hope it gets better with time.

Definitely a good way for people who haven't read the manga to learn about Oda's masterpiece.",02-Sep-23,6.0,yeah best manga adaptation ever doesnt serve imo lacks lot mangas original humor story also bit different good original characters diverge manga garp exemple laid back always laughing grandpa bear manga fights wich highlights manga suite boring way luffy gathers crew doesnt feel natural manga think longtime fans manga like little bit disapointed still nice watch first season lets hope gets better time definitely good way people havent read manga learn odas masterpiece

It sometimes gets a little stoic and awekward, but if i could speak and understand Japanese, i would have thought so about the anime too.

Horrible adaptation,They have a massive budget to make this show and still show feels like it's being rushed. Luffy is not as great as anime where he is this free spirit bt shows luffy doesn't feel great. Garp is not even shown properly in anime till water 7 arc but it's already in the show like a main character. They skipped fight in baratie and introduced along early. They erased hacchi completely even though he is way more important than arlong. Entire show feels stupid at times like how koby led marines during captain kuro saga even though he just joined. They didn't show buggy back story. Sanji doens't have eyebrows like anime and he doesn't flirt like he does in anime . Usopp doesn't get any screentime.

I need more episodes!,"Like anyone else... I'm hesitant when is comes to Live Adaptations or redoing anything from the past.. but I've got to say.. as someone who HASN'T actually seen the anime.. this makes me want to! I've seen a lot of anime and put off this show, but now I just want more one piece!!

Speaking of which.. I would love this show to continue! It's not afraid to be creative or silly, but also isn't obvious or simple storytelling.

Don't go expecting it to be as dare I say 'realistic' as something like POTC.. (pirate-wise)..

It's MEANT to be extreme, silly, mad, and SUPER DUPER anime-style of fights and characters!

One thing I love is the worldbuilding! It's been a long time since something engrossed me in the cinematic universe of the show (i.e Star Wars, ect.) but this show NAILS it!

Bear in mind.. this isn't a show for kids.. it may be funny and stupid at times, but it doesn't mean it's kiddy writing.

Great Adaptation of animanga and also a great standalone TV show,"One piece is one of the greatest stories ever told in the form of a fantasy epic in modern day literature written and drawn by Eiichiro Oda and one piece deserves a lot more recognition and appreciation from across the globe.

This adaptation does justice to the original as much as possible, adapting the first introductory saga (55 chapters of manga) of the main plot of one piece. And the story, characters , themes, depth, world building etc gets better and better as the plot moves forward.. and this season 1 only covers the initial part of that epic journey which gives a glimpse of what's about to come.

It has captured the grandioseness of the world, the humor, the lovable characters who are very easily relatable to even new audience. It does all the things with compact pacing to make sure that the new audience are fed with sufficient information to understand the dynamics of the fantastical world, without needing any prior knowledge, hence making it a perfect adaptation. It's not only for the fans but also for the new audience.

One thing I would suggest to new audience is that the show intrinsically packs lots of mystery, secrets with it about the world, fantasy elements and others. So, many things are not revealed though necessary information is still provided, and the breadcrumbs left through different hints, clues, foreshadowings is one of the fun parts of one piece and the adaptation also succesfully does that as well.

As a long term one piece fan, I personally really liked the Netflix live action adaptation of one piece. The show runners Matt Owens under the guidance of Oda sensei absolutely nailed the impossible of adaptating as goofy silly absurdist fantasy story with a deeper darker undertones like one piece, the source material, into a live action medium.. and they suceeded in it. The casting, chemistry, characters, sets... Production value are all perfect.

The heart, charm and tone of the original is there making it a good adaptation. But simultaneously, it also feels like a good TV show by itself.. with great cinematography, writing, sets, dialogue, characters, plot, characters and many more.

It's not perfect but they can iron things out in subsequent seasons.. as they've nailed the most important things of it pretty well.

There were few changes which slightly degraded the already great experience of the live action... But majority of the changes are just recombining and modifying the plot to give similar versions of the character moments with the main crew without compromise by changing the sequence of events or combining events or restructuring them to fit a faster paced narrative without losing the character moments and growth of the main crew.

Many other changes are actually based on future events or past events revealed far later in the anime... Which flesh out a lot of other things in the world and those changes also make sense.

I wish the backstories are 2-3 min longer at least... Which would make them feel even more fleshed out.

Even though the anime was way more impactful, it did make me teary in those emotional moments... And that's a win for Netflix's one piece.

There is a lot of clever dialogue writing going on, with a lot of subtext, references, eastereggs only long term fans can understand... adding additional enjoyment to the fans, especially who are invested in the world. And also the dialogues give a lot more insight into the characters, their experiences, with few words without showing much. That's brilliant and efficient.

The overall flow of the story, the major plot points are accurate to the manga, though few are either out of order or with slight readjustments and alterations... most of which were pretty good changes which doesn't affect the characters much... But makes the pacing crisp to fit in 8 episodes.

I suggest anyone who is watching it, if possible please dont binge it. It is more enjoyable to watch it and consume it slowly, digest it and enjoy the journey... as It's giving a lot and theres lot to unpack in it.

And one more thing, one piece fans who are watching it, Just have trust in Oda and dive into it without judging every change they've made, as it might seem out of place compared to the animanga, but at the end almost every change makes sense keeping the one piece story as a whole with respect to the manga to-date.

I had to binge it due to time constraints, but it would've been even better experience for me if i took my time.

Basic,"What a shame it is when a beloved anime doesn't translate well into live-action. The casting and production choices may not have lived up to fans' expectations. It's disappointing when a show doesn't capture the essence of the original. And it's not just the looks, but the overall quality seems lacking too. It's almost as if they were working with a tight budget and just randomly picked people to play the characters. That's a major letdown for fans who were hoping for something epic. It's like another Dragon Ball Z situation, where the live-action version falls short of expectations. It's such a shame when a beloved anime doesn't transition well to the big screen. The casting and production choices could have been so much better. And when a show fails to capture the essence of the original, it's a major disappointment. We were all hoping for something amazing, but it seems like they missed the mark. üòî",31-Aug-23,2.0,shame beloved anime doesnt translate well liveaction casting production choices may lived fans expectations disappointing show doesnt capture essence original looks overall quality seems lacking almost working tight budget randomly picked people play characters thats major letdown fans hoping something epic like another dragon ball z situation liveaction version falls short expectations shame beloved anime doesnt transition well big screen casting production choices could much better show fails capture essence original major disappointment hoping something amazing seems like missed mark
THE GOAT ODA DID NOT DISSAPOINT,"Props to the director and production casts for breaking the live action curse. Honestly, I really made this IMDB account so that I can leave my review and rating here. For once I didn't doubt Oda for making such masterpiece. I'm glad I'm watching One Piece at it's peak. What I really love about the show is how accurate is the characters are, even the real VAs are doing the dubs. The nostalgia hearing them voiced the characters again after how many years. May I also include the production setting, costume design, prosthetics, acting and music was top tier. It was a majestic experience having to watch your childhood come to life.

Spectacular,"FUN to watch. Only watched 2 eps and its probably the best live action we have had so far but after 20 years of actual anime one piece, its extremely hard to separate the 2 and give the live action a fair review. I enjoyed it, people hate and criticize everything and then wonder why everything sucks, just enjoy the show and keep it moving. I think it's an 8 outta 10. Fun ride and great for a starter to one piece. For someone who has read/watched every episode it isn't exactly the same but it's their own thing and I'm ok with that.

very good adaptation,"I have seen 4 chapters and I found this live action very good. Interpretation of zoro 10/10 nami 10/10 (she's so cute) 10/20 luffy 10/10 usopp 10/10 cobby 10/10.

Garap 10/10

The only thing I didn't like is that the adaptation of the manga/anime is not done 100% as in the case of the places, fights and dialogues.

But I understand that if that were the case, it would be too long a series. So it doesn't bother me that some things change if the end result is the same. But in general and I say it as a fan of one piece, I loved the series 10/10.

Best thing netflix produced since stranger things!,"Netflix regained my faith with this one!

I grew up watching One Piece and this was my unexpected full circle moment!

It was an epic watch, that really had me captivated for the entire day. For me that was the best show of the year so far.

I was mainly worried about the CGI, casting decisions and the show having too much filler. None of it happened.

In my opinion, they really made the right choices about when to stick and stray from the anime.

If I had to list one flaw it would be that I was hoping the villain was going to be a tiny bit more developed.

"AS AN ANIME FAN, THIS IS ON FIRE !","Actually, I was never a fan of live action adaptations of animes, but this one is lit. I understood it as soon as I saw Luffy from the trailers. The actors and actresses couldn't be better ! I liked Luffy, he has the spirit. Zoro is just what I could have imagined. Nami's character looks like a little different, colder than the anime, but still, the actress is just on point. I liked Usopp, even though he doesn't have long nose. Sanji is okay. Buggy and Shanks are dope. I must admit, Shanks is really really good. When they stay loyal to the original, that's what I like. I hope they don't ruin other characters in the future. I can't wait to see Chopper, Robin and Crocodile next season.

They changed the plot a bit, but these changes are not bad. They did their best to adapt the first 45 episodes of the anime into 8 episodes of series. While I was watching, I thought to myself that how good it would be to see some famous faces playing some characters that don't have too much screen time. They used to do it in Friends, I hope this show becomes so famous that most famous faces agree to do a cameo. For example Eminem as Kami Enel, Hulk Hogan as Whitebeard, Jim Carrey as Bon Clay, etc. I know some of these are just dreams but hey, I'm a dreamer just like the characters of this show.

Great show but it has its flaws,"It has many differences from the anime and Manga butstill the same premace and overall story progression. This show feels like it is trying to make up for the slow pacing of the anime by making the story go much faster than it needs to. Sometimes characters just feel out of place, this is partially because of some characters are wearing clothing from much different time periods. I feel some of the actors could have been casted differently. I know this review is most likely not composed very well but this show is still quite good and very well written and most of the actors did amazing, but it has bad pacing for the opposite reason the anime did.",31-Aug-23,9.0,many differences anime manga butstill premace overall story progression show feels like trying make slow pacing anime making story go much faster needs sometimes characters feel place partially characters wearing clothing much different time periods feel actors could casted differently know review likely composed well show still quite good well written actors amazing bad pacing opposite reason anime
Great Adaptation,"As far as anime adaptations go and even live action adaptations of animated properties in general, this is about the best there is. It perfectly captures the essence that made the original so beloved and competently adapts it to exist in a completely different medium.

Genuinely feel like this is the gold standard for this type of project at the moment. It's not a very high bar considering most of these live action anime adaptations are some of the worst pieces of media you've ever seen, but this show definitely stands on it's own as above average. The fact that this is not only a strong adaptation but a strong television show in general is astounding. I'm pessimistic that this will ever happen again with another property, but at least there's this to prove that it's possible.",10-Sep-23,8.0,far anime adaptations go even live action adaptations animated properties general best perfectly captures essence made original beloved competently adapts exist completely different medium genuinely feel like gold standard type project moment high bar considering live action anime adaptations worst pieces media youve ever seen show definitely stands average fact strong adaptation strong television show general astounding im pessimistic ever happen another property least theres prove possible
I hope,"I was hoping for Kaya's part.. and the pirate who exploits her did not end up like this.. I was hoping that he would escape and catch up with Luffy and every time he would be defeated by Luffy.. so that he would be a somewhat comical character

Also, the character of Usopp is a wonderful comedic character. I hope that he will be changed from the manga and become an independent character in the series because he mastered the role with the best performance.

I hope that Chef Zef will move his ship after taking a dose of enthusiasm through Luffy, or go to places where there are ship battles and serve food.",03-Sep-23,10.0,hoping kayas part pirate exploits end like hoping would escape catch luffy every time would defeated luffy would somewhat comical character also character usopp wonderful comedic character hope changed manga become independent character series mastered role best performance hope chef zef move ship taking dose enthusiasm luffy go places ship battles serve food
It was awesome.,It was really good though some story was changed but it can't be helped knowing how bending one piece really is with its unique characters and storyline. The adaptation kept all the characters authentic and just like anime. And even the story was only slightly altered and that alteration kind of made it more fun for anime watcher to watch it. It has some faults but it gets covered after seeing our beloved manga and anime turned into real life. I really hope that everyone's watch it and like it because it was the best adaptation of anime I have ever seen. CGI is really great as well as world building.

Emily Rudd's hair as Nami,"Everything went so right with casting and their looks. But i have a prob with Emily's choice of hairdo/wig for the live action. Her insta posts of her actual short hair already looks perfect as it is for nami. We may never get a hundred percent exact replica of the anime counter part (which is why sanjis hairstyle looks different but awesome fr a live action) they could have left Emily's hair as it is, there are many shots which was uncomfortable too look as it was obvious she was in a wig which was all curly and messy all the time. I wish they make it more natural in S2. Emily is perfect as nami, and yes hair choice could make or break a character as the others looks jst fine.

it's a worthy adaptation of a beloved manga series,"First of all, I can believe that out of all manga, One Piece - the fabled 'how in the world you even adapt it' - did it. It broke the curse of live action adaptations. Because it's good! It's genuinely is good!

It does not top the original manga, but it *doesn't have to* - it does justice to the manga, and it's good enough to be its own thing.

It is a great introduction to the series for people who only heard about One Piece but didn't have it in themselves to pick up such a behemoth. If this shall become the bridge some need to cross to see whether this story is for them, I am happy to know this bridge is a worthy adaptation that paints the picture of Strawhats' beginnings almost perfectly.

It's fun, it's silly, it's dynamic, it is serious where it should be. The characters are believable to me, with different qualities put to the focus but still true to what they should be.

The major drawback of being a long-time fan is that I can't escape comparison, since my own interpretation of the series makes me attached to certain scenes and put weight on certain phrases, so I can't help but miss them where they're not included. That being said, I am very impressed with the script, the vision of the show is its own while retaining the spirit of the epic fairytale that One Piece is.

The remixed plotlines and inclusion of original scenes and more screentime for other characters give more context to what's going on and bridge the arcs into a single, flowing story. In my opinion, they struck a balance between not underexplaining and not overexplaining, to make it appeal both to people who are unfamiliar with the story so they aren't lost in what's going on, and to people like me who know lore through and through. It's a fresh vision that keeps most of the plot beats intact (most, because I do have points to disagree with the writers about) and gives a lot of nudges and winks and easter eggs. Shows the love and care that went into this show.

J'adore .. Merci,"As a fan of One Piece since 2007, I've read and watched everything ... To see the work finally adapted into Live Action was a nice surprise ... but also quite simply a logical continuation of this unusual and ultimate universe ... We shouldn't have done just anything with this adaptation, because the work is grandiose and deserves to be known by the general public in the most beautiful of ways, and because ordinary fans are attached to it beyond simple adoration... Apparently, THEY UNDERSTOOD all that :) ... and so much the better... I watched and enjoyed almost everything... and above all I stopped watching at one point to judge, but rather I got close to the suspense of the events of the scenes... and that's where they succeeded !!!!

So, YES YES, there are plenty of things to review and improve to live up to the original work ...

Delightful and fun from a non-fan's perspective,"I can't speak to fidelity to the original anime, but what I can say is this show is a breath of fresh air, set sail away from grimdark into a colorful and hopeful world, accompanied by great choreography and well done special effects. Casting is superb as well.

My wife, who is a non-anime fan, loved it as well. It is very accessible and doesn't info dump. They do a great job of cutting what I am sure is a huge amount of material while leaving a very strong and charming story.

Luffy in particular has such a tremendous charm and is actually believable in his naive optimism, but the whole cast absolutely does a great job.

I didn't like how nami was presented in the adaptation cause it was totally different from anime and even sanjis actor was average,ussop was good.

I'm been a One Piece fan for a few years and I was amazed by all the little hints in the show that are only for true fans of the series.

AMAAZZZING,"The live adaptation of One Piece was nothing short of a magnificent masterpiece that left me utterly amazed. To be honest, I had some reservations about how well the beloved anime and manga series could translate to live action, but this production shattered all doubts. It was an extraordinary experience, and I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.

What truly stood out was the consistent improvement in each episode. It felt like a crescendo of excitement and intrigue, with every installment outshining the previous one. The way the story built up to the climactic final episode was nothing short of mind-blowing. The writers, directors, and actors did an exceptional job in capturing the essence of Eiichiro Oda's epic tale and bringing it to life on screen.

A significant part of the success undoubtedly goes to the impeccable casting. Each character was portrayed with such precision and authenticity that it felt like they had stepped straight out of the manga. The chemistry among the actors was palpable, making the bonds between the Straw Hat Pirates and their allies feel as real as ever. This synergy contributed immensely to the overall immersion.

Let's not forget the breathtaking set pieces. The attention to detail in recreating the iconic locations from the One Piece universe was remarkable.

I found myself completely engrossed, and time seemed to slip away. I didn't want to leave this captivating world, and I eagerly await the next adventure in season 2. The anticipation is palpable, knowing that the creative team behind this live adaptation has the talent and passion to continue delivering the same level of excellence. It's a testament to the enduring appeal of One Piece and its dedicated fanbase that continues to grow with each exciting chapter of this epic saga.",22-Sep-23,10.0,live adaptation one piece nothing short magnificent masterpiece left utterly amazed honest reservations well beloved anime manga series could translate live action production shattered doubts extraordinary experience couldnt pleasantly surprised truly stood consistent improvement episode felt like crescendo excitement intrigue every installment outshining previous one way story built climactic final episode nothing short mindblowing writers directors actors exceptional job capturing essence eiichiro odas epic tale bringing life screen significant part success undoubtedly goes impeccable casting character portrayed precision authenticity felt like stepped straight manga chemistry among actors palpable making bonds straw hat pirates allies feel real ever synergy contributed immensely overall immersion lets forget breathtaking set pieces attention detail recreating iconic locations one piece universe remarkable found completely engrossed time seemed slip away didnt want leave captivating world eagerly await next adventure season anticipation palpable knowing creative team behind live adaptation talent passion continue delivering level excellence testament enduring appeal one piece dedicated fanbase continues grow exciting chapter epic saga
"Fun, we laughed, and beautiful photography",Zoro's performance was amazing. And the pirate is a bugger. What's nice is that it summarizes the important events in One Piece... and one of the bad things is the choice of Nami's sister... and the best thing is that there are no external agendas in the series. We hope that the rest of the series will follow the same approach and that external agendas will not interfere with it.....and that the selection of the upcoming characters will be more precise so that it becomes the greatest series. I hope that the dramatic side will be more than the comedic side... and that the directing will be better.,04-Sep-23,8.0,zoros performance amazing pirate bugger whats nice summarizes important events one piece one bad things choice namis sister best thing external agendas series hope rest series follow approach external agendas interfere itand selection upcoming characters precise becomes greatest series hope dramatic side comedic side directing better
It's not exact but didn't have to be,There were definitely noticeable shifts in the plot of the east blue saga but all in all it was a great adaptation of what I consider the greatest story ever told. Some characters are perfect reflections of their manga and anime counterparts while others changed to fit the tone of a live action verion. I noticed early a lot of the anime's goofy moments wouldn't translate the same so I was able to live with a lot of tweeks. Such as a grandfather punching his 8 yearold grandson and leaving goose eggs not having a funny tone if done in real life. I am eager to see how they handle the next season as many fan favorite characters will be introduced and more of the world of One Piece will be revealed.,04-Sep-23,10.0,definitely noticeable shifts plot east blue saga great adaptation consider greatest story ever told characters perfect reflections manga anime counterparts others changed fit tone live action verion noticed early lot animes goofy moments wouldnt translate able live lot tweeks grandfather punching yearold grandson leaving goose eggs funny tone done real life eager see handle next season many fan favorite characters introduced world one piece revealed
Best anime to live adaption,"This story is truly amazing, featuring beautiful scenery and fantastic characters portrayed by talented actors. Oda, the sole author of the manga and anime, played a vital role in creating this real-life adaptation. It's a must-watch, deserving a minimum rating of 10 out of 10, and it could easily be 100 if I could rate it that high. The only drawback is that it condenses around 100 episodes into 8, which might be too fast-paced for some viewers. However, the live action effectively highlights the most crucial plot points. If you haven't seen the anime, you can jump straight into episode 100, but it's advisable to double-check.

For Those Unfamiliar with the Manga or Anime: A Cautionary Note on Watching the Live Action,"Adapting the beloved ""One Piece"" manga and anime into live-action is a daunting task. The source material, created by Eiichiro Oda, has a massive following due to its intricate plot, diverse characters, and rich world-building. In live-action, visual fidelity and pacing are key challenges. Achieving the same level of visual appeal and character depth through CGI is demanding, while pacing differences can affect character arcs. Notable differences in the live-action version include a faster pace and alterations to character portrayals and plot points. Striking a balance between honoring the source material and appealing to a broader audience remains the central challenge.",02-Sep-23,4.0,adapting beloved one piece manga anime liveaction daunting task source material created eiichiro oda massive following due intricate plot diverse characters rich worldbuilding liveaction visual fidelity pacing key challenges achieving level visual appeal character depth cgi demanding pacing differences affect character arcs notable differences liveaction version include faster pace alterations character portrayals plot points striking balance honoring source material appealing broader audience remains central challenge
Best live action made of anime,Not perfect but definitely enjoyable. Has it's downsides but it was really cool to see my favorite story coming to life. Acting wasn't perfect and cinematography could be way better. But crew chemistry and interactions were on top and I like how they expanded on crew's dynamics like Nami's and Zoro's siblings relationship. And I like how they expanded on things that were only mentioned in manga. Some changes I don't like like though like placing Zoro's flashback into arc that has nothing to do with him. But overall it was really fun to watch I want s2 now One piece curse breaker All of anime live actions were bad until this point but none of previous live action was a la of one piece.,01-Sep-23,10.0,perfect definitely enjoyable downsides really cool see favorite story coming life acting wasnt perfect cinematography could way better crew chemistry interactions top like expanded crews dynamics like namis zoros siblings relationship like expanded things mentioned manga changes dont like like though like placing zoros flashback arc nothing overall really fun watch want one piece curse breaker anime live actions bad point none previous live action la one piece
So much better,"So much better than that stupid cartoon. They've fixed the acting, the pacing, and the live action is so much better than the animation. I really don't get why the cartoon is so popular. I barely made it through the first season. I hear it gets better but it hurts too much to get there. This at least makes me understand a bit more why the cartoon is so popular.

I think they've cast this well and it seems to follow the plot well without all of the useless scenes and horrible dialogue.

We'll worth a watch if like me you didn't get the original. Or if you're totally new to it. The mature rating I thought was a bit high as it means lots of kids will miss out.",01-Sep-23,8.0,much better stupid cartoon theyve fixed acting pacing live action much better animation really dont get cartoon popular barely made first season hear gets better hurts much get least makes understand bit cartoon popular think theyve cast well seems follow plot well without useless scenes horrible dialogue well worth watch like didnt get original youre totally new mature rating thought bit high means lots kids miss
Great adaptation!!,"Great adaptation by Netflix. My wife and I started the series and couldn't stop, it was the first thing we watch at breakfast and at night before bed. It's amazing how they transferred it without sacrificing the core message of the series. The character chosen was a great pick, they all embraced the animation characters as they should. The picture, design, production all played a great role. I bet this is gonna be a great success.

You will be happy if your a one piece fan,As a die hard core fan myself this is my favorite Anime and I wasn't disappointed in this you can tell the effort was there for once with a live action adaptation. My only complaint is I wish they would have stuck with Don Krieg as the main villain instead of Mihawk because it didn't reall leave a impact with same result it would have been better for him to show up for up for a few minutes and fight zoro like in the anime. I really excited for new seasons and hopefully we get Alabasta and water 7 arc. The cast all are great and we'll suit for the rolls they fit just like a glove. I had a great time.,01-Sep-23,10.0,die hard core fan favorite anime wasnt disappointed tell effort live action adaptation complaint wish would stuck krieg main villain instead mihawk didnt reall leave impact result would better show minutes fight zoro like anime really excited new seasons hopefully get alabasta water arc cast great well suit rolls fit like glove great time
A SORRY ATTEMPT!,"Being a hardcore fan of one piece, i tried to give this an honest shot. This just isnt one piece. It simle isnt. The luffy, its cringy (way too much overacting with cliche untimely dialogues). Production design is good but it wont be enough, i dont think this will be renewed to seson 2.

I couldnt connect to any character at all, the guy playing zoro was doing some decent acting but the rest were just cringeworthy. The overall feel of the show is whitewashed way too much. With forced accents and bad acting. This series isnt as bad as other anime attempts but i predict that it will be forgotten as well. I really hope that now ODA focusses on manga and bring this story to a good closure.",31-Aug-23,1.0,hardcore fan one piece tried give honest shot isnt one piece simle isnt luffy cringy way much overacting cliche untimely dialogues production design good wont enough dont think renewed seson couldnt connect character guy playing zoro decent acting rest cringeworthy overall feel show whitewashed way much forced accents bad acting series isnt bad anime attempts predict forgotten well really hope oda focusses manga bring story good closure
NOT ONE PIECE BUT A MASTER-PIECE,"In the world of entertainment, there are few achievements as monumental as successfully adapting an anime into a live-action TV show. With great excitement and anticipation, I dived into this remarkable transformation, and I am thrilled to report that it exceeded all expectations. This live-action adaptation is a true masterpiece, earning a perfect 10/10 rating from me.

First and foremost, the casting choices were nothing short of inspired. Every character from the beloved one piece was brought to life with such authenticity that it felt like they had stepped right out of the source material. The actors not only resembled their animated counterparts but also captured the essence of their characters flawlessly. It's evident that an immense amount of care went into selecting the cast, ensuring that each member of the ensemble brought their A-game to the project.

The production values of this live-action show were nothing short of spectacular. From the intricate set designs to the breathtaking special effects, every aspect of this adaptation was crafted with meticulous attention to detail. The world-building was so immersive that I found myself transported to the anime's universe, and I could hardly believe that I was watching a TV show rather than experiencing the anime firsthand.

Moreover, the writing and storytelling were top-notch. Adapting an anime into a live-action format can be challenging, as it requires condensing or expanding storylines while maintaining the essence of the original. This show managed to strike the perfect balance, staying true to the source material while adding new layers of depth to the narrative. The character arcs were beautifully developed, and the pacing was flawless, keeping me engaged and invested in every episode.

One of the most commendable aspects of this live-action adaptation was its respect for the source material. It was clear that the creators were die-hard fans of the anime, and they made every effort to honor its legacy. Iconic scenes and moments from the anime were faithfully recreated, evoking a sense of nostalgia and wonder that fans like me cherished.

The action sequences were a visual spectacle, choreographed to perfection. The martial arts and combat scenes were executed with such precision and flair that they rivaled the intensity of the anime. It was exhilarating to see the characters' signature moves and abilities brought to life on screen with such finesse.

Furthermore, the soundtrack of this live-action TV show was a symphony of emotions. The musical score seamlessly transitioned from heart-pounding action to poignant character moments, enhancing the overall viewing experience. It was clear that the composers understood the importance of music in conveying the anime's themes and emotions.

In terms of character development, this adaptation shone brightly. It delved deeper into the backgrounds and motivations of the characters, allowing viewers to connect with them on a more profound level. For example koby and garp, the show gave them so much depth we connected wirh the characters more. Relationships and friendships were explored with nuance and authenticity, making every interaction feel meaningful and heartfelt.

In conclusion, this live-action TV show based on an anime is a triumph of adaptation. It successfully captures the magic and essence of the source material while adding its own unique flair. The impeccable casting, stunning production values, and exceptional storytelling make it a must-watch for fans of the anime and newcomers alike. With a perfect 10/10 rating, this adaptation stands as a shining example of how to bring anime to life on the small screen. It's a true masterpiece that will be celebrated for years to come, leaving an indelible mark on the world of television.",03-Sep-23,10.0,world entertainment achievements monumental successfully adapting anime liveaction tv show great excitement anticipation dived remarkable transformation thrilled report exceeded expectations liveaction adaptation true masterpiece earning perfect rating first foremost casting choices nothing short inspired every character beloved one piece brought life authenticity felt like stepped right source material actors resembled animated counterparts also captured essence characters flawlessly evident immense amount care went selecting cast ensuring member ensemble brought agame project production values liveaction show nothing short spectacular intricate set designs breathtaking special effects every aspect adaptation crafted meticulous attention detail worldbuilding immersive found transported animes universe could hardly believe watching tv show rather experiencing anime firsthand moreover writing storytelling topnotch adapting anime liveaction format challenging requires condensing expanding storylines maintaining essence original show managed strike perfect balance staying true source material adding new layers depth narrative character arcs beautifully developed pacing flawless keeping engaged invested every episode one commendable aspects liveaction adaptation respect source material clear creators diehard fans anime made every effort honor legacy iconic scenes moments anime faithfully recreated evoking sense nostalgia wonder fans like cherished action sequences visual spectacle choreographed perfection martial arts combat scenes executed precision flair rivaled intensity anime exhilarating see characters signature moves abilities brought life screen finesse furthermore soundtrack liveaction tv show symphony emotions musical score seamlessly transitioned heartpounding action poignant character moments enhancing overall viewing experience clear composers understood importance music conveying animes themes emotions terms character development adaptation shone brightly delved deeper backgrounds motivations characters allowing viewers connect profound level example koby garp show gave much depth connected wirh characters relationships friendships explored nuance authenticity making every interaction feel meaningful heartfelt conclusion liveaction tv show based anime triumph adaptation successfully captures magic essence source material adding unique flair impeccable casting stunning production values exceptional storytelling make mustwatch fans anime newcomers alike perfect rating adaptation stands shining example bring anime life small screen true masterpiece celebrated years come leaving indelible mark world television
Fun time for new and old fans,"As a long time One Piece fan, i decided to watch this with someone who never had any contact with the original story. Even with changes and cuts necessary to this type of medium I loved how they kept the heart of One Piece alive, and at the end of the day, the person I was with had the same feelings i had for the characters just by watching the live action, so that's how you know they did a good job. The actors were amazing, the scenarios is breath-taking and they even managed to breath a new life in a few arcs or characters that didn;t impress me much in the original material. I don't think I have ever seen so much love in a piece of media before.

A 'Shattered' One Piece Adaptation,"I have read every single chapter and watched every single episode of One Piece. The announcement of a live action adaptation brought so much excitement. I started the series with low expectations, but I still end up being disappointed.

While I was not expecting a 1:1 adaptation of the series but I hoped they'd do a good job. The casting is decent, though. They managed to hire actors who managed to exude the aura of the main Strawhat crew, especially Godoy and Mackenyu.

As expected from Netflix, they made changes to some characters - typical race and gender swapping. They also made considerable changes to the storyline by removing some important scenes while interjecting things that should not have been done earlier in the story. It seems that they are trying to compress several arcs into one season.

While the acting of the main Strawhat character and some side characters are worthy of praise, some characters' perfromance just fell flat.

The production design is decent but it exuded more of a Pirate of the Caribbean's feel rather than capturing the environment of the One Piece world.

This is a decent pirate movie for those who have not consumed any One Piece media. But as an adaptation of the beloved franchise, this is just not it.",01-Sep-23,4.0,read every single chapter watched every single episode one piece announcement live action adaptation brought much excitement started series low expectations still end disappointed expecting adaptation series hoped theyd good job casting decent though managed hire actors managed exude aura main strawhat crew especially godoy mackenyu expected netflix made changes characters typical race gender swapping also made considerable changes storyline removing important scenes interjecting things done earlier story seems trying compress several arcs one season acting main strawhat character side characters worthy praise characters perfromance fell flat production design decent exuded pirate caribbeans feel rather capturing environment one piece world decent pirate movie consumed one piece media adaptation beloved franchise
"Not bad, but not the one piece we know","Writers took to many liberties, I understand it is an adaptation but there are things you can modify and there are things you can't.

Baroque works in the first episode?

Zoro escapes the marines without joining the crew?

Luffy arrives Syrup village without meeting Usopp, and he chooses the Merry?

Luffy asks Kaya for the Merry? It suppose to be a surprise gift.

Marines don't suppose to get involved in the Kuro battle, specially Coby.

Writers modify to much, the actors are not bad choices, but they need more character to be the embodiment of the roles they are playing.

Its not bad,"Its really.... its not bad. I really like this, but some changes i dont really like. But as live action they done really good job, buggy, mihawk, garp, kuro are really good looking. I think Kuro with Buggy are the perfect copies of the anime characters. But there are some things that was bugging me. Luffy was good, but sometimes, he done something that luffy will never do. For example thinking through fight with buggy. Zoros vow hasn't the feeling like in anime, byt fight with Mihawk was good.

In my opinion this is not a disaster, but it also no close to perfection. It is the gold middle a if there will be more seasos, i will watch it, but they still dont convince me that this will be as good as anime. Huge plus is jap dub, for anime lovers its.must watch.

Every Anime Fan should watch this!,"The first season was so overwhelming. If you've seen anime live action movies before and were always disappointed, you should definitely give this one a chance. The characters are great, there are a lot of Easter Eggs, even more details (like Garp is already in the first episode). The action and also the joke of the anime are there, especially with the latter I had even that this is lost.

My Thoughts on One Piece Netflix adaptation,"Netflix's take on the iconic anime ""One Piece"" had the potential to introduce this incredible world and its characters to a whole new audience. However, what we've been given is a lackluster adaptation that fails to capture the magic of the original source material.

One of the most disappointing aspects is the writing. The show's dialogue often feels forced and unnatural, with characters delivering lines that don't align with their personalities or the context of the scene. This results in interactions that lack the charm and authenticity that fans of the series hold dear.

The visual effects and CGI are another sore point. From the awkwardly rendered Devil Fruit abilities to the underwhelming depiction of certain environments, the adaptation struggles to deliver the awe-inspiring visuals that make the anime stand out. The world of ""One Piece"" is rich with vibrant landscapes and imaginative creatures, but Netflix's adaptation falls short of bringing these elements to life.

The pacing is a major issue as well. While the original series thrived on a careful balance between action, character development, and exploration, Netflix's adaptation seems to rush through events without allowing for any meaningful build-up. This haste strips away the emotional resonance that made the original so beloved, leaving audiences disconnected from the characters and their journeys.

Another letdown is the casting. While diversity in casting is important, the actors chosen for key roles often lack the chemistry and depth required to bring their characters to life. The performances appear wooden and uninspired, leaving viewers struggling to invest in the characters' experiences.

Furthermore, the adaptation's attempt to inject humor often falls flat. While ""One Piece"" is known for its lighthearted moments, the adaptation's comedic timing feels forced and out of place. These attempts at humor often detract from the story's flow, preventing the audience from becoming fully immersed in the narrative.

In conclusion, Netflix's ""One Piece"" adaptation fails to capture the heart and soul of the original anime. The lack of attention to detail in writing, visuals, and character portrayal results in a lackluster experience that falls short of the high expectations the source material sets. While the adaptation may appeal to those unfamiliar with the series, it's disappointing for longtime fans hoping for a faithful and captivating retelling.",31-Aug-23,1.0,netflixs take iconic anime one piece potential introduce incredible world characters whole new audience however weve given lackluster adaptation fails capture magic original source material one disappointing aspects writing shows dialogue often feels forced unnatural characters delivering lines dont align personalities context scene results interactions lack charm authenticity fans series hold dear visual effects cgi another sore point awkwardly rendered devil fruit abilities underwhelming depiction certain environments adaptation struggles deliver aweinspiring visuals make anime stand world one piece rich vibrant landscapes imaginative creatures netflixs adaptation falls short bringing elements life pacing major issue well original series thrived careful balance action character development exploration netflixs adaptation seems rush events without allowing meaningful buildup haste strips away emotional resonance made original beloved leaving audiences disconnected characters journeys another letdown casting diversity casting important actors chosen key roles often lack chemistry depth required bring characters life performances appear wooden uninspired leaving viewers struggling invest characters experiences furthermore adaptations attempt inject humor often falls flat one piece known lighthearted moments adaptations comedic timing feels forced place attempts humor often detract storys flow preventing audience becoming fully immersed narrative conclusion netflixs one piece adaptation fails capture heart soul original anime lack attention detail writing visuals character portrayal results lackluster experience falls short high expectations source material sets adaptation may appeal unfamiliar series disappointing longtime fans hoping faithful captivating retelling
Great show!,"Amazing show that respects the source material. There were certainly some things I would have wanted to be done better, such as the bond between our main characters seemed a tiny bit superficial, however, the portrayal of almost all characters was on point. A lot of scenes were shot so cinematic, it definitely brought the iconic epic feel to the show. The portrayals of certain characters like mihawk, buggy and shanks was leaps and bounds beyond my expectations. All the changes they made to the original storyline hit the mark as well.

Terrible,"The only people giving positive reviews are oda/one piece fanboys. Everyone saying they've ""never watched anime"" sure ok buddy we definitely believe you.

The show is objectively bad.

Disney shows get better acting out of the abused 4 year olds.

The script is cringy every chance it gets. The casting for characters was abysmal. This is on par with avatar live action the only difference in reviews are due to the following the anime has.

If you like this you can't tell me the dragonball live action was bad because the quality on that was much better and even that was trash not worth watching.

I won't believe anyone that tells me they watched the first 15 mins and continued to watch without seeing the anime prior.

An attempt to make a live adaptation of the greatest story ever told,"It feels like, the writers of the adaptation overheard someone talking about One Piece and written the script from what they could remember. Lacks the amazing story telling the original anime has.

Acting is only OK, at best. The costumes, though, feel like a cheap cosplay.

The music feels generic, not at par with the music used in the anime. Actually, at times it reminds me of the music used in the Witcher.

I was not expecting much from the CGI. At least that met the expectation.

For a casual viewer this will be a nice way to pass time while gobbling some food. For One Piece lovers, it will feel like a torture.

SO WORTH THE HYPE!!!,"AWESOME!!! I signed up today with both Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB just so I could give this masterpiece of an anime live action a superb rating, because that's how deserving it is. One Piece has always been my all-time favorite anime. And Netflix gave it so much justice with their live action adaptation. They made the best decision to cooperate with Oda-sensei. The casts are perfect for their roles, especially the Straw Hat crew. The execution is great. I could never say enough. I really love it! I'll be binge-watching the pilot season over and over again. I look forward to the next season. Whether you love One Piece, or if you're finding what it's all about today, or if you've been let down by so many live action adaptations in the past, or whatever your reason might be to doubt or believe in its hype...

You can definitely tell Oda is executive producer.,"The adaptation is really good!

Once you spot all the weird stuff from the manga/anime kept in the show you immediately know that Oda is not a man who'll let Netflix ruin his work.

They've done great job with the pacing in my opinion.

The story is progressing very fast compared to the anime, but none of the core elements or character buildup seem to be missing so far.

The production value is obviously insane. With the staggering budget of 18m per episode. And last but not least I think the casting is great! The guy portraying Luffy is brilliant! Garp, Usopp, Koby are perfect. Zoro and Nami, I guess will be up for debate among the community but I personally like these selections as well.

"Honest review from a die-hard One Piece fan, since last 12+ years.","As much as I wanted this live-action to succeed so that the original One Piece saga spreads out to the every nook and cranny of the world , for me, live action wasn't even close to the actual One Piece experience that I got from watching the anime and reading the manga.

I'm not a hater, and I was genuinely hoping that the live action could perhaps actually capture the essence of what One Piece actually is about , but it majorly failed to do so.

Its probably just a one time watch, to be seen only when you have nothing better to look out for.

Now regarding what I think was missing from the live action was : Full of stupid clich√©s, and really stupid dialogues. No sense of direction or any sort of real emotion whatsoever. Majorly failed to get that comic/comedy feeling that was supposed to be Luffy's entire persona. Main character like Luffy, Usopp were not even remotely close to the originals from the manga/anime.

Many people out there be saying , "" oh no, you cant get a copy/paste of One Piece in live action"", man, This is THE goddamn ONE PIECE we are talking about, if you can't even get it right by looking at manga and anime , then why bother. I wouldn't have any problem if they rename the live series to anything else, but if you're using the name One Piece, get it right !!

I URGE THE AUDIENCE WHO WATCHED THE LIVE ACTION TO KINDLY GO AND WATCH THE ONE PIECE ANIME.....the live action totally and majorly missed/ruined the major ""nakama"" scenes like from Nami's Village, Zoro's I won't lose again, Sanji""s departure among many others.

And let's be real, they did the fishmen CGI absolutely dirty. And this was just the first step in a whole lotta more CGI.

Only thing I liked was the actors of Nami, Sanji. Those absolutely nailed it. Zoro was meh/ok . But Luffy and Usopp , hated them , felt like Inaki was trying too hard to be Luffy and just couldn't be him, and well Usopp was simply just not the Usopp from OP Universe.

I swear I wanted the live action to succeed but if this is and will continue to be the case, i just wish they end this here.",14-Sep-23,5.0,much wanted liveaction succeed original one piece saga spreads every nook cranny world live action wasnt even close actual one piece experience got watching anime reading manga im hater genuinely hoping live action could perhaps actually capture essence one piece actually majorly failed probably one time watch seen nothing better look regarding think missing live action full stupid clichs really stupid dialogues sense direction sort real emotion whatsoever majorly failed get comiccomedy feeling supposed luffys entire persona main character like luffy usopp even remotely close originals mangaanime many people saying oh cant get copypaste one piece live action man goddamn one piece talking cant even get right looking manga anime bother wouldnt problem rename live series anything else youre using name one piece get right urge audience watched live action kindly go watch one piece animethe live action totally majorly missedruined major nakama scenes like namis village zoros wont lose sanjis departure among many others lets real fishmen cgi absolutely dirty first step whole lotta cgi thing liked actors nami sanji absolutely nailed zoro mehok luffy usopp hated felt like inaki trying hard luffy couldnt well usopp simply usopp op universe swear wanted live action succeed continue case wish end

Officially my favorite show on Netflix,I never seen the anime but after watching this i am now watching the anime from beginning to end. I loved everything about one piece live action. The casting was perfect. They brought these anime characters to life and they did a perfect job at making it accurate to manga. I couldn't get enough of this show and I hope they make multiple seasons. They did a beautiful job at designing the pirate ships and giving each crew a uniqueness. The fight scenes were so well choreographed as well. The story telling was extremely accurate to. I recommend this show to all one piece fans and even people new to the series like myself. I'd give more than 10 stars if possible!!,16-Sep-23,10.0,never seen anime watching watching anime beginning end loved everything one piece live action casting perfect brought anime characters life perfect job making accurate manga couldnt get enough show hope make multiple seasons beautiful job designing pirate ships giving crew uniqueness fight scenes well choreographed well story telling extremely accurate recommend show one piece fans even people new series like id give stars possible
Best live action ever made from a mediocre anime,"(I've watched the anime until episode 1071) (No Spoilers)

This live action surpasses the original anime with a much faster pacing but still keeping what's important for the story in the longrun even adding stuff that wasn't mentioned in the early episodes of the anime. It's comedy actually works and is not meant for 5 years old kids like in the anime, there are some changes I do not like but overall I think the cast is perfect and they improved what was shown in the anime.

The problem? The fight scenes, some of them are good but most of them look way too dumb, characters movements look weird, I think they should've made more belieable fight scenes if the intention was to take fights seriously and not them being a joke.

And in fact one piece anime isn't that good, as for this live action I think it is watchable, it is ok to recomend this to people but is no way good enough to rate it over 6/10 the plot remains boring even with a faster pacing than the anime, at least characters aren't as annoying as in the anime.",02-Sep-23,6.0,ive watched anime episode spoilers live action surpasses original anime much faster pacing still keeping whats important story longrun even adding stuff wasnt mentioned early episodes anime comedy actually works meant years old kids like anime changes like overall think cast perfect improved shown anime problem fight scenes good look way dumb characters movements look weird think shouldve made belieable fight scenes intention take fights seriously joke fact one piece anime isnt good live action think watchable ok recomend people way good enough rate plot remains boring even faster pacing anime least characters arent annoying anime
I know they tried... But Damn...,"One thing I can say for sure, subjective as it is, the vibe of the whole thing just reminded me of the Dragonball Evolutoin, that with better graphic and technology.

Well not all of it though, just look at that Arlong's overall appearance.

As the main character, the portrayal of Luffy can be nitpicked all day long but I will point out some things that really bugged me. The portrayal doesn't really do anything for me. The level of innocence was misplaced and felt too cringey at times.

And that strawhat, honestly... They can make effects as if he was stretching his body like a rubber but they could not make the hat without a strap? Can't they just like glued it to his head or something? It looks weird when it was worn with the strap tightly held the face, that is so thick they might as well bedazzled it with glitter.

Story wise I can't complain, it made sense when it was told 20 years ago to a 10 year old me, but seeing it being retold again in a different fashion like this, something in my gut was just not having it.

Props to fans who liked it, but please spare people like me who just want to voice their opinion on a topic so beloved.",31-Aug-23,1.0,one thing say sure subjective vibe whole thing reminded dragonball evolutoin better graphic technology well though look arlongs overall appearance main character portrayal luffy nitpicked day long point things really bugged portrayal doesnt really anything level innocence misplaced felt cringey times strawhat honestly make effects stretching body like rubber could make hat without strap cant like glued head something looks weird worn strap tightly held face thick might well bedazzled glitter story wise cant complain made sense told years ago year old seeing retold different fashion like something gut props fans liked please spare people like want voice opinion topic beloved
Meh but fun to watch.,"Not a great show but was was entertained. Reviews that are an 8-9-10 out 10 are very misleading and over hyped, but that is just an opinion of an opinion. This show sticks very close to the anime but it is too anime for a live action adaptation, needs more of its own identity. Most character designs are done well but a few standout. Set pieces were really well done and felt lived in due too practical effects. Main characters will hopefully get a better chance to show depth. This probably would have been a 5 out 10 review but they nailed the snail and its looks and sounds. That kind of attention and detail is appreciated.",05-Sep-23,6.0,great show entertained reviews misleading hyped opinion opinion show sticks close anime anime live action adaptation needs identity character designs done well standout set pieces really well done felt lived due practical effects main characters hopefully get better chance show depth probably would review nailed snail looks sounds kind attention detail appreciated
It was the best anime adaptation of all time. The best of the worst.,"Ne Piece.

So, the plot was adapted excellently, and the casting for the male roles was simply 10 out of 10. I was genuinely surprised. How could they find such perfect Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji?

And how could they find such inappropriate actresses for ALL the female roles?

Seriously, it feels like they were chosen by either a misogynist or some woman who thinks all women should be ugly and capable of playing hero roles.

Okay, Netflix. I'm a white woman with red hair and some extra weight. Will you cast me as Vivi? What? According to your criteria, I'm a perfect fit, right?

Jokes aside, let's go through the facts.

Nami - normal. You did well with the main characters.

Makino - in the anime, she's a young and beautiful woman. In the series, she's a tired woman in her 40s.

Nojiko - in the anime, she's a cute girl with good manners. In the series, you changed her skin color. That would be fine if the actress matched the general type and behaved like the manga heroine. But she's aggressive and swears. Ugh!

And most importantly, Kaya. She's a young, delicate, and beautiful 18-year-old girl. Explain to me why a scary 43-year-old woman is playing her role. Are you serious? Do you think age isn't visible on screen?

Okay, casting actresses is just the first act of Netflix's misogyny.

The second act is their makeup and costumes.

Male characters have their issues with this too, but it's less noticeable. ALL female characters have hair problems. It's like they've been dyed with washable colored gel. Okay, you fixed it for Nami later. But the eyebrows. Oh my god! Why do all women's eyebrows differ so much from their hair? You didn't do it so noticeably for men. Kaya is supposed to be a natural blonde. Why does she have such huge, black eyebrows?

Male costumes are usually more realistic. Adequate colors, fit well. For women, it's like you sewed costumes from the brightest and stretchiest fabric. And it looks very cheap! Plus, all the girls have unique body features. Because of this, you have to tailor costumes to accommodate these features to make them look good! For example, Nami is slim. But why do you sometimes make her butt look so big with your costumes? There are many such examples.

There can be mistakes with male costumes too. The costume, beard, and, most importantly, Mikokka's lenses look like they're from AliExpress.

I'm not a costume designer, but I'll give you advice. When you order costumes from online stores, remember that the characters have already worn them. They shouldn't be brand new, bright, and clean. This is not a cartoon; it's a series. Even though it's fiction, some rules of reality should apply here.

In general, what I wanted to say is this: Netflix, it was a great attempt, but don't ruin the series in the second season.

I urge you to think about the people responsible for casting female characters, costumes, and makeup. Despite the poor graphics in some places, these two simple factors greatly affect the impression of the anime.

Soon, Vivi should appear in the plot. If she doesn't match in terms of age, skin color, figure, and behavior, I will skip this series.

Don't mess with the canon just because someone in your leadership has bugs in their head. Listen to the audience. The normal audience, manga fans, not the 5% of people who want to see black mermaids, changes in character orientations, and so on.

Netflix, you almost got it.

"Great, but Luffy 'Inaki' could be better","Luffy 'Inaki' spoilt this for me, his acting felt really unnatural, perhaps it's the script, but his dialogue and expressions doesn't look natural, doesnt have that natural 'Luffy' charm. It's almost 'B' acting, a lot of his scenes looks forced, especially in those 'wholesome' moments, it's over the top. He looks the part, yes, but that's about it.

Most of the other actors are very good, especially Nami (Emily Rudd). Zero gets better further into the episodes, at first, like Luffy, his scenes feel a bit off, especially this kid actor.

The One Piece is Real,"Objectively, the One Piece TV show is flawed and probably doesn't hold up to most other shows. It has awkward fight scenes at times, the gum gum fruit is barely shown (due to budget and cgi) and some episodes do drag a bit. Nevertheless, I loved it and can't wait to see more. It might not be for the average viewer, but if you're a fan of the manga, you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised. The acting and casting is frankly amazing and the set pieces are on par with the show/manga. Also, since it's much shorter, the arcs have been updated to fit the format and it beautifully worked.

I wish they had gotten Luffy's laugh into the show somehow but that's a small thing and Inaki Godoy did an amazing job. It's clear One Piece fans were involved with the making of this.

You show nami's sister find out she is not villain after nami told her but in anime her sister and villagers knew it from biggining......

Well done,"They did an awesome job retelling the East Blue saga on the first 8 episodes.

Casting are good especially with that of the Straw Hats and the Marines (a big applause to the actors of Luffy, Zoro, and Garp!); something's weird though with other casts specifically Arlong, Makino, Nojiko, Shanks and Mihawk though their acting did justice to the characters they are portraying.

Movie effects and transitions are also great. Location setting are also fantastic (except the Bar managed by Makino lol).

Music? That's a meh for me. They should at least used an original One Piece soundtrack.

Exceeds my expectations as a manga/anime follower,"If you're wondering about the ""One Piece"" hype that came along with the release of the live action adaptation produced by Netflix, this is for you.

In case you're completely new to ""One Piece"", here are some major points you need to know:


One Piece is a weekly Japanese Manga that started in 1997 and is still ongoing to date. Anime adaptation lauched in 1999.



""One Piece"" world is extremely vast and includes 1,200+ NAMED characters. It has 1090+ Manga chapters and 1050+ Anime episodes to date.



According to multiple sources, by August 2022, it had over 516.6 million copies in circulation worldwide, easily placing it in the list of ""Most sold book series of all time""



The story takes place in a fantasy world that very much mirrors many aspects of our own. However silly or quirky the story may seem, it takes on very relatable aspects from our world such as (Racism, politics, misuse of authority, corrupt media, drug abuse, etc.)



Despite having over 1000+ chapters, every single chapter, panel, dialogue, event OR side character in this series has its weight. Everything amounts to something in One Piece and eventually pays off.



The Author ""Echiro Oda"" is a literal god of Foreshadowing. In many instances throughout the story, he would throw in a small ""Easter Egg"" in a dialogue or in the form of objects or writings in the background of a panel only to come into relevance hundreds of chapters later. Once you look back into the story, you realize it was all there from the very start but you just weren't looking.



As a result of that, a huge part of the one piece fanbase formed one of the most interesting and interactive communities out there discussing theories, discussing their understanding of events & sharing their amazing findings that would explain a lot of the mysteries thrown at us one after another by the author. In fact the community is so active that the author himself follows the most popular theories and sometimes even twists the story around just to constantly go against expectation.



The best part about One Piece and what really makes it unique from most other long series is that the author had the exact ending of the story and the end of every major character's arc written since the very beginning and all the events are written and created building up to that promised ending, relating everything into one epic final arc.



In case you're wondering ""Is it a good time to get started on the story now?""
Well definitely yes! One piece is relatively nearing its end, every single chapter nowadays has a big reveal or an explanation of something mysterious that's been long awaited for years.

Recently, Netflix produced a live action adaptation of the story. Needless to say, fans that have been following the story for years were worried sick giving their previous terrible or unsuccessful experiences with live action adaptations of their favorite stories for many different reasons.

Here's my personal rating and opinion of the live action series after watching it for the 1st time focusing on every point that was personally worrying me since they announced it:

Character adaptation: 8/10 ‚≠ê

Biggest point of worry because in one piece A LOT of characters appear or sound goofy & silly, from characters' weird faces or body proportions & sizes to character dialogues with every character having a unique sounding laugh to the insane abilities that characters have that would be incredibly hard to present in a live action. To my surprise they did incredibly well so far. The cast is really good and they all seem to know their characters very well. My only take is that besides casting all characters from mostly correct origins, Netflix still had to put their touch and ""diversify"" a couple of characters for absolutely no reason. Also, why does luffy have a lisp??

Dialogues & Major plot points: 10/10 ‚≠ê The show writers definitely did an outstanding job including all major plot points in the produced arcs so far. They even made sure to include small but now known easter eggs from the early chapters that just honestly made me smile to see included.

Pace of events: 9/10 ‚≠ê Pacing seems fine so far giving that they need to compress full arcs into fewer episodes. The first 8 episodes of the series that were released so far cover the majority of 5 complete arcs which make up a total of 95 manga chapters and 44 anime episodes. My only worry is it might be too fast for some more event heavy story arcs.

Costumes, filming locations, CGI & effects: 10/10 ‚≠ê Not much to say there. To be honest, they got almost everything on point when compared to the original manga.

Overall personal rating based on points above: 9.25/10 ‚≠ê

If I were to describe ""Echiro Oda"" and his story ""One Piece"" in one word it would no doubt be GENIUS.

Giving that I personally consider ""One Piece"" the only story I ever stumbled upon that deserves a 10/10 rating in all aspects, and besides all the worrying about this live action adaptation of the story not meeting expectations, I found it incredibly enjoyable to watch and I am definitely going to be rewatching it more closely soon.

Can not believe it. What a journey.,"First off will state that I loved One Piece before going in. So I was already predisposed to enjoying this type of story. But in saying that, I thought this show was excellent and incredibly easy to watch. It did not feel like a slog to get through at any point and was hoping for more episodes after my 8 episode binge.

For the majority of the show I was smiling and having a great time, so I would happily rewatch it and hope my review might just convince one extra person to give it a shot. Anything to help get a season 2 over the line. Hence my first ever IMDb review.

From Fans to the Fans,"Live-action adaption of one piece shows his strengths by adhering its source materials with devotion. Awesome chemistry of the cast, the ambience and coherent set pieces, the absurdity and the plot point that move like a clock is all here as they were a staple of One Piece Manga/ Anime. And when it tries to be its whole thing, it becomes genuine.

Although, there are some hardships seen on screen as a result of adapting a 24 year old lore and by probably choosing to be more an imitiation sometimes instead of an adaptation; ONE PIECE live action generally lives up to its promises and gets the fans (like me) excited for the future of the series.

I can only hope that the magic of One Piece that kickstarted this series will last and support this successful first outing for many more sagas.",14-Sep-23,8.0,liveaction adaption one piece shows strengths adhering source materials devotion awesome chemistry cast ambience coherent set pieces absurdity plot point move like clock staple one piece manga anime tries whole thing becomes genuine although hardships seen screen result adapting year old lore probably choosing imitiation sometimes instead adaptation one piece live action generally lives promises gets fans like excited future series hope magic one piece kickstarted series last support successful first outing many sagas
Best show of the year? NOPE!,"I won't call it best show of 2023 but it definitely is one of the best Anime to Live action adaptations. It's a show that you can recommend even to anime haters.

Episode one was a bit rocky, Alvida did not have that fierce look on her face, it was like that actress auditioned to be an Angel but got the role of a Demon. She didnt fit the role. But that's my only complain.

Everything was all fun from episode 2 onwards!

They compressed 80 anime episodes into 8 episodes and it works! It's not an exact copy of the anime but it has the same overall storyline. Example: instead of fighting the whole crew of the Black Cat Pirates, they only fought 3 members (Possibly due to budget constraints) but I still loved the episode! Kuro, Mihawk, and Shanks had the perfect actors.

I want more! So that I can finally watch the anime once the TV Show reaches up to the same point as the anime. Great job to everyone involved in the project!",01-Sep-23,9.0,wont call best show definitely one best anime live action adaptations show recommend even anime haters episode one bit rocky alvida fierce look face like actress auditioned angel got role demon didnt fit role thats complain everything fun episode onwards compressed anime episodes episodes works exact copy anime overall storyline example instead fighting whole crew black cat pirates fought members possibly due budget constraints still loved episode kuro mihawk shanks perfect actors want finally watch anime tv show reaches point anime great job everyone involved project
"Never followed this Animanga before, after watching this live action series I'm ready to become the new nakama.","I've never followed the animated series and manga One Piece at all, but I've been quite interested to watch One Piece: Live Action since the trailer was released.

This series looks very magnificent, starting from the production design, vfx, sfx, cinematography everything looks very 'expensive' and suitable. Maybe the vibes will be more exciting and enjoyable if watched on the big screen.

An interesting little thing about this series, the title logo of each episode always changes and describes what is the highlight of the characters of each episode.

The selection of main characters, character development & back story of each main character is also quite good. But, what bothers me is that there are several characters other than the main character whose expressions lack life in conveying their emotions. Then, the use of wigs on several characters also looks less natural.

However, this series is still enjoyable and easy to follow, especially for the beginners like me who have just become a nakama. And there are several emotional moments that make my eyes tear up in several scenes.",04-Sep-23,9.0,ive never followed animated series manga one piece ive quite interested watch one piece live action since trailer released series looks magnificent starting production design vfx sfx cinematography everything looks expensive suitable maybe vibes exciting enjoyable watched big screen interesting little thing series title logo episode always changes describes highlight characters episode selection main characters character development back story main character also quite good bothers several characters main character whose expressions lack life conveying emotions use wigs several characters also looks less natural however series still enjoyable easy follow especially beginners like become nakama several emotional moments make eyes tear several scenes
As a long time One Piece reader I just LOVE this show,"I think it is a very well made adaptation of the original story. It pushes all the buttons I adore in One Piece. The show has me in tears even in multiple rewatches. What is great about this show, that it also a chance for One Piece fans to re-life the whole adventure freshly.

The actors are all very good and most of them exceptional. The characters they portrayed all have their individual story arc which all beautifully resolve within the season.

The climax of the season will have you on the edge and the last 10 Minutes marks the beginning point of an epic adventures with characters you really feel attached to.

Revived the love inside,"I watched One Piece about 10 years ago. I collected the manga and was an avid fan of the show. After some years I moved on from my anime days and no longer had the interest to watch any anime the way I once did. One Piece was always in my heart, but I felt I outgrew the goofiness of the show and my patience wore thin waiting for chapters week after week, mangaka hiatuses and the such. The anime's quality of animation deteriorated drastically around the 500-600 episode mark. These reasons pushed me to let go of my deep love for one piece. What happened next was never expected or even dreamed of. Netflix announced the live action adaptation. I severely doubted the idea. How could they ever make a high quality adaptation of such a long, far from reality type of story. The trailer seemed promising and i allowed myself to get excited for the premiere. I am so glad I watched this. I'm so grateful Netflix worked closely with Oda on this. My expectations were exceeded with the amount of love they put into the production. The casting was so well done. As the show continues, the cast will only grow into their roles even more than they already have and I can see the magic that this show can and WILL be. One Piece is an incredible, record breaking masterpiece of fiction that truly deserves the glory and praise. This show was the tribute to the story that was deserved and rightfully earned, of the few anime adaptations I have seen, this stands in a league of its own. The only cons I had were the sometimes awkwardly close camera shots (very minor complaint) and the music scores. Still weren't bad, just could be a lot better. The crew casting was amazing. The villains casting was amazing. Everyone knew their part and played it WELL!!! BRAVO NETFLIX. BRAVO ODA. This is what your art needed. My boyfriend who never watched anime a day in his life joined to watch the season with me and adored it just as I did. Due to the amount of time since I even watched One Piece I didn't notice the story alterations. They were most likely necessary to keep the story palatable for new viewers and keep the pacing consistent throughout the season. From my recollection, a ton of the production was line for line, cut and paste from the manga/anime. Which I totally appreciate. How else were they supposed to capture the beauty that is One Piece? I truly can't wait for season two and I highly recommend all One Piece Fans new and old give this a go, as the creator deserves the recognition for his art on a larger platform and you will be very surprised at how enjoyable it ends up being.",04-Sep-23,10.0,watched one piece years ago collected manga avid fan show years moved anime days longer interest watch anime way one piece always heart felt outgrew goofiness show patience wore thin waiting chapters week week mangaka hiatuses animes quality animation deteriorated drastically around episode mark reasons pushed let go deep love one piece happened next never expected even dreamed netflix announced live action adaptation severely doubted idea could ever make high quality adaptation long far reality type story trailer seemed promising allowed get excited premiere glad watched im grateful netflix worked closely oda expectations exceeded amount love put production casting well done show continues cast grow roles even already see magic show one piece incredible record breaking masterpiece fiction truly deserves glory praise show tribute story deserved rightfully earned anime adaptations seen stands league cons sometimes awkwardly close camera shots minor complaint music scores still werent bad could lot better crew casting amazing villains casting amazing everyone knew part played well bravo netflix bravo oda art needed boyfriend never watched anime day life joined watch season adored due amount time since even watched one piece didnt notice story alterations likely necessary keep story palatable new viewers keep pacing consistent throughout season recollection ton production line line cut paste mangaanime totally appreciate else supposed capture beauty one piece truly cant wait season two highly recommend one piece fans new old give go creator deserves recognition art larger platform surprised enjoyable ends
Don't watch this is you love the anime,"So many bits have been missed from anime. For starters the king of the pirates is Gol 'D' Rodger not gold Rodger and he never says the famous phrase "" my treasure can be found in one piece""; You know the title of the thing. Annoyed me a lot seeing as you find out that what links Rodger to luffy and fist fire ace.... It's the D in their names. Got half way through episode one and gave up.

I'm not a fan of One Piece, but this live action really makes me believe in other anime adaptations.

From episode one to eight everything was done neatly, making me unable to stop watching. Damn this is cool.

Thanks to everyone behind this film you guys are the best.

And for Netflix, I want season 2 of all the live action adaptations, which is the most successful in my opinion.

Can't wait for season 2,"I've been optimistic about the series since it was announced. I was eagerly waiting to see how they bring this anime to life? Especially when Oda Sensei himself was overlooking the project, and trust me I was not disappointed at all. The casting was perfect. Each of the actors embodied their characters beautifully, and the chemistry they had among them was prominent even in the show. The setting of the whole series was more serious than the anime, but given that they had to cover lots of chapters in one season, it's understandable. I personally think the interactions between Garp and Koby could have been cut down a little to show more of the straw hat crew. Also some scenes lacked emotions, like Zoro's promise to Luffy and Sanji leaving Baratie. In the anime/manga, these scenes are very emotionally attached to the fans, so I believe the actors could've showed more emotions in these scenes to make the viewers connect to the original feeling more. But overall, I'm satisfied with the series, and I can't wait to watch season 2.",03-Sep-23,10.0,ive optimistic series since announced eagerly waiting see bring anime life especially oda sensei overlooking project trust disappointed casting perfect actors embodied characters beautifully chemistry among prominent even show setting whole series serious anime given cover lots chapters one season understandable personally think interactions garp koby could cut little show straw hat crew also scenes lacked emotions like zoros promise luffy sanji leaving baratie animemanga scenes emotionally attached fans believe actors couldve showed emotions scenes make viewers connect original feeling overall im satisfied series cant wait watch season

Don't compare 2d with 3d,"When viewing the live-action adaptation, I approached it as a standalone production, distinct from the One Piece anime. I maintained an awareness of the disparity between the realms of reality and animation, thus enabling me to make clear distinctions. My initial expectations for the show included a heightened level of realism while preserving some of the whimsical elements reminiscent of the original series, and I found that these expectations were pleasantly surpassed.

For those who regard the live-action adaptation as a failure, I would encourage a shift in perspective. During my viewing experience, I often drew parallels with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise to emphasize that this adaptation features real-life actors rather than animated characters.

If one's perception of the live-action version is that it fails to capture the essence of One Piece, it may be due to a desire for it to more closely resemble the 2D world. However, it is crucial to recognize that live-action is an entirely distinct medium. The decision to significantly alter certain scenes was made in light of this distinction, akin to the separation between manga and anime, with manga being a printed form of media, anime being an animated format, and live action involving live actors.",03-Sep-23,10.0,viewing liveaction adaptation approached standalone production distinct one piece anime maintained awareness disparity realms reality animation thus enabling make clear distinctions initial expectations show included heightened level realism preserving whimsical elements reminiscent original series found expectations pleasantly surpassed regard liveaction adaptation failure would encourage shift perspective viewing experience often drew parallels pirates caribbean franchise emphasize adaptation features reallife actors rather animated characters ones perception liveaction version fails capture essence one piece may due desire closely resemble world however crucial recognize liveaction entirely distinct medium decision significantly alter certain scenes made light distinction akin separation manga anime manga printed form media anime animated format live action involving live actors

And managed to incapsulate a lot of elements of his character development in just 8 episodes that reflected a good couple hundreds in the manga.

I had all of my doubts at first for the casting choices, and just taking this behemoth of a show to the Live Action scene in general, And had my reservations.

After the first couple episodes all types of nostalgia hit super hard.

A lot was cut out and a bunch of characters were, but at the same time it stayed true to the canon / the main story, so it didn't feel forced / budget constraints.

Best anime adaptation,"It would be alright to say that it's the best live action adaptation ever created. I've been a huge fan of one piece since I started watching anime and anything else gives me a joy as much as One piece. I watched the anime nearly 30 times over and over and would never miss a detail. So, appearance of small details hidden in the episodes were really interesting and exciting. Of course there would be tad little changes in the storyline to make ot more real-life adapted, and it was not bad at all, they were all making most perfect sense. Seems like some people are complaining about Sanji's eyebrows not being curly, it would look ridiculous in real life. You can see it could be ridiculous if it's too much like cosplay from two kitties from Kuro Pirates.",03-Sep-23,10.0,would alright say best live action adaptation ever created ive huge fan one piece since started watching anime anything else gives joy much one piece watched anime nearly times would never miss detail appearance small details hidden episodes really interesting exciting course would tad little changes storyline make ot reallife adapted bad making perfect sense seems like people complaining sanjis eyebrows curly would look ridiculous real life see could ridiculous much like cosplay two kitties kuro pirates

Great work for beginning!,"I really enjoyed watching this live action. I know it's really hard to replicate all of the things from Anime/Manga into 8 episodes. I hope that the episode can be more, like 10-12. Instead of making it rush into 8.

The thing that I hope can be improve is the storyline. Too many scenes for Garp and Koby. Instead of making that scene, it should be more focus on detailing every scenes of strawhat crew. I hope that the storyline can be exactly the same as manga, but just trim unnecessary scenes or characters.

Just amazing,"As an anime One Piece fan, I was worried they will not give this art what it deserves; but netflix nailed it, if you are watching One Piece for the first time, you should know this is just the beginning! Too many details packed in every scene that will come back later in the show, this was almost 40 episodes of the anime (out of the 1074 episodes as I am posting this review) and yet the One Piece is still not revealed.

The only cons that I have is the CGI fail sometimes, which is ok since it is just the first time thay Oda (the manga creator) and Netflix work together. I am certain that as the show goes on for season 2, 3 and 4 etcetera, it will get better as the funds will increase in value if the show gets the attraction which Netflix is hoping to get.",03-Sep-23,10.0,anime one piece fan worried give art deserves netflix nailed watching one piece first time know beginning many details packed every scene come back later show almost episodes anime episodes posting review yet one piece still revealed cons cgi fail sometimes ok since first time thay oda manga creator netflix work together certain show goes season etcetera get better funds increase value show gets attraction netflix hoping get

A season with 15 episodes would be fair. 8 episodes are just not enough. I know that is easy to say but I hope there'll be more episodes in the next seasons.

It has Heart & Soul of One Piece,"One Piece Live Action Series has adapted the Manga/Anime quite well, although there were few things missing which I had have loved to see if they had included those minute details as well, but at the same time there were many scenes which I thought came out better here even more than its Manga/Anime counterparts, and most importantly, it was so much fun to experience the journey in a new form with a bit different plot and execution but with same end goal. I feel I wouldn't have liked it as much if it was just an imitation of the original source, that is, the manga/anime, because then there would have also been so many scenes from the chapters/episodes of the manga left out due to it being just 8 episodes long season so flow would have been awful. Also, the plot wouldn't have made much sense to a non-one-piece-manga/anime fan if they had followed the manga/anime one to one. It was such a joy to sail with the Straw-Hat crew.

Also, the things that can be made better in season 2 are the CGI and an increase in number of episodes to make the flow of the scenes even better which felt a bit off during few scene-transitions but I don't mind them at all in comparison to love and happiness I felt watching this :D.",01-Sep-23,9.0,one piece live action series adapted mangaanime quite well although things missing loved see included minute details well time many scenes thought came better even mangaanime counterparts importantly much fun experience journey new form bit different plot execution end goal feel wouldnt liked much imitation original source mangaanime would also many scenes chaptersepisodes manga left due episodes long season flow would awful also plot wouldnt made much sense nononepiecemangaanime fan followed mangaanime one one joy sail strawhat crew also things made better season cgi increase number episodes make flow scenes even better felt bit scenetransitions dont mind comparison love happiness felt watching

At times I was even shocked because they're were some moments that didn't even make into the anime, because it was to graphic, like Sanji's backstory. During this whole section I was like ""Surely they won't go there"", and they did. I like who you they kinda switch it up but come to the same conclusion as the manga/anime. As a One Piece fan, I'm truly satisfied.",01-Sep-23,10.0,im happy show onetoone adaptation animemanga course part stayed true material thing op fan wanted get fresh look world another take exactly got times even shocked theyre moments didnt even make anime graphic like sanjis backstory whole section like surely wont go like kinda switch come conclusion mangaanime one piece fan im truly satisfied
Breaking the curse?,Ahh absolutely loved. Even though the scenes aren't the same as in the manga and or anime they did a fantastic job with casting and everything else. I do wonder why they didn't show some people who are important to the storyline like Hachi and the brothers who helped out zoro. But I'm sure Oda has something f in mind if he chose it that way. I watched in english and switched it to spanish from time to time and their voices are perfect. Even better when I learned that the voice for Luffy and Sanji were the actors voices in spanish. Overall I give this a very high rating and loved everything about it. I can't wait to see what happens for the next season as they were able to fit so much on on to the 8 eps.

Entertaining & fun! Story is a bit different from the manga tho,"I'm a bit confused with this series.. honestly i get it when people said most of the cast has terrible acting, i kinda can see it.. but i still find it fun to watch and somehow craving for more episodes.. i think the way they acts just fits with the series' style.

Being fan of the manga (the anime, not really) of course i'm a bit upset with the way the story is changed and some of my favourites characters are scrapped. But the joy i felt watching it weighs more than the things that upsets me.. even though there are characters that doesn't make the cut, the story instead focused on characters that considered minor in the manga. Boggart has more spotlight here, and the inclusion of mr.7's appearance is a really nice touch! I treat this series as filling the holes of the source material.. Oh and in spite of all the colorfulness, i had to warn you that this live action is more gory & bloodier than the manga.",06-Sep-23,9.0,im bit confused series honestly get people said cast terrible acting kinda see still find fun watch somehow craving episodes think way acts fits series style fan manga anime really course im bit upset way story changed favourites characters scrapped joy felt watching weighs things upsets even though characters doesnt make cut story instead focused characters considered minor manga boggart spotlight inclusion mrs appearance really nice touch treat series filling holes source material oh spite colorfulness warn live action gory bloodier manga
"The story is good, but only main character, others is bad casthing","If you are anime fans, i think you agree with me! The casthing is. I know Oda sensei is go to have check this but its mostly like i killed my dream to see all character beauty and brutall in Pirate things. I feel like the chacTer should be at least be like a anime. Not just replace it someone that should be strong with drunk gentlement.

Dont just replace beauty ladies with i dont know how to soeak this. If sanji really in real life. He will die to see all the charcter. But i can said all main character is good choice. Story was okey since get cut a lot from anime, thats understandable. Anyway im still doesnt feel to watch till episode 3. Not interested.",03-Sep-23,6.0,anime fans think agree casthing know oda sensei go check mostly like killed dream see character beauty brutall pirate things feel like chacter least like anime replace someone strong drunk gentlement dont replace beauty ladies dont know soeak sanji really real life die see charcter said main character good choice story okey since get cut lot anime thats understandable anyway im still doesnt feel watch till episode interested
Really well done,"I have just finished the first season and I can say that this is a good watch for anyone looking for something a bit different but also and especially if you're a fan of the anime - it's highly unlikely you'll be disappointed. It's edited down from the anime but not in any way that misses the original plot. It nails all of that just not in the drawn out style the anime does it and with a somewhat more natural characterization, which is a good thing as most would know real life actors generally don't register well when trying to be just like their animated version.

The cast, sets and production etc are great quality and resemble their animated counterparts very well also. A bit more realistic proportions perhaps (: Only one or two things come to my mind as looking a bit budget, no big.

I can't see any reason why this won't continue on into many more seasons... which begs a question. There's a whooooole lot of One Piece anime to cover (over 1000 episodes of that) and still going after 24 years; will this adaptation just keep on going too?

I sincerely hope so.",19-Sep-23,9.0,finished first season say good watch anyone looking something bit different also especially youre fan anime highly unlikely youll disappointed edited anime way misses original plot nails drawn style anime somewhat natural characterization good thing would know real life actors generally dont register well trying like animated version cast sets production etc great quality resemble animated counterparts well also bit realistic proportions perhaps one two things come mind looking bit budget big cant see reason wont continue many seasons begs question theres whooooole lot one piece anime cover episodes still going years adaptation keep going sincerely hope
Awesome show!!,I have never heard of the anime One Piece or even seen the show but the live action had me hooked from the beginning !! I am usually hesitant of watching live action version of any anime series because they never usually get it right. Not sure how the live action compares to the anime but show is by far the one of best live action I have seen. I loved all of the characters in this series and the storyline was very well done. I ended up binge watching the entire series over the weekend. So if you have not seen the show yet give it a chance you will not be disappointed. Can't wait to see season 2!,04-Oct-23,9.0,never heard anime one piece even seen show live action hooked beginning usually hesitant watching live action version anime series never usually get right sure live action compares anime show far one best live action seen loved characters series storyline well done ended binge watching entire series weekend seen show yet give chance disappointed cant wait see season

Great anime adaptation,"Really good adaptation of anime, with the advaantage that everything happens really fast, a lot of action in only 8 episodes. I have never been a One Piece fan, so it's a nice opportunity to undersatd and enjoy one of the best mangas out there.

One of the standout features of this adaptation is its breakneck pacing, delivering a whirlwind of events in a mere 8 episodes. For viewers accustomed to the often slow burn of certain anime, this approach might feel like a breath of fresh air. The narrative unfolds rapidly, pulling the audience into a rollercoaster of emotions and revelations. The accelerated pace, however, does not compromise the depth of the story; rather, it enhances the impact of key moments, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.",09-Oct-23,7.0,really good adaptation anime advaantage everything happens really fast lot action episodes never one piece fan nice opportunity undersatd enjoy one best mangas one standout features adaptation breakneck pacing delivering whirlwind events mere episodes viewers accustomed often slow burn certain anime approach might feel like breath fresh air narrative unfolds rapidly pulling audience rollercoaster emotions revelations accelerated pace however compromise depth story rather enhances impact key moments keeping viewers edge seats
ANIME & MANGAS FIRST LIVE ACTION SUCCESS,"As a fan of the series since I was a kid I can say I was really nervous about hearing it was getting a live action animation. So many shows have tried and failed to ever really capture the essence of a series. One Piece is not those series. This show has done a beautiful job capturing the spirit of adventure and freedom that comes with One Piece's journey. The casting was spectacular with Luffy being a standout for me as the perfect man to play the role, his smile is definitely one I would follow to the ends of the ocean with!

Highly recommend, keep an open mind everything in this series has purpose.

Some fun notes about this series: Eiichiro Oda was heavily involved in the making of this live action and even had reshoots done to truly capture the spirit These episodes summarize about 95 chapters of the manga or 44 episodes on the anime, definitely recommend checking both out if you're interested for a much more in depth adventure!

I cried so many times from pure joy of the curse of live action being ended as i watched this amazing cast emerse me into their world.

Amazing journey through Arlong park ark,"Just wow, waiting for season 2. I was nervous about this live action, but it was worth it, I loved it.. Can't say it was perfect, but you have everything that you need to grab you into this journey. I was kinda hoping for a ""bigger"" fight with arlong, but, the ending moves were there. The actors were amazing, Zoro , Sanji, Mihawk and ofcourse Nami, you can really see the effort putting on this. Overall i really recommend all the OP fans to watch this series, with an open-mind ofcourse, cause you will enjoy and hopping for the full show. Thank you to Netflix for investing and believing on this show, and ofcourse Mister Oda-senpai for this great journey!",18-Sep-23,9.0,wow waiting season nervous live action worth loved cant say perfect everything need grab journey kinda hoping bigger fight arlong ending moves actors amazing zoro sanji mihawk ofcourse nami really see effort putting overall really recommend op fans watch series openmind ofcourse cause enjoy hopping full show thank netflix investing believing show ofcourse mister odasenpai great journey
Very good,"As a big one piece fan, i thought this adaptation would be terrible. Expecially after seeing the trailers.

But they nailed it, even my wife likes it. And i've been trying to get here to see one piece for ages haha. I really hope they make a second season.

Makes me want to watch the whole anime again.

Great job at showing the backstories and though there are a few differences with the anime. The most important things are there.

All in all its a must see show, the casting of zoro is spot on btw! This guy makes the show great for me!

Recommend this to everyone, enjoy the wonderfull world of one piece.",04-Sep-23,10.0,big one piece fan thought adaptation would terrible expecially seeing trailers nailed even wife likes ive trying get see one piece ages haha really hope make second season makes want watch whole anime great job showing backstories though differences anime important things must see show casting zoro spot btw guy makes show great recommend everyone enjoy wonderfull world one piece
Most faithful and high quality adaptation since Lord of the Rings,"I haven't written a review in a very long time but as a long-time fan of One Piece and cinematography in general, I had to stop and say: Bravo!

Adapting any type of source material to either the big or small screen is an almost impossible endeavor. An attempt that will likely end up in failure in almost every single case, even when the crew and producers care about it.

One piece is a rare exception. A gold nugget. Something I haven't seen since Lord of the Rings. If you are a fan of the original manga today is a day of celebration. Call a couple of friends, buy a giant pizza and go watch it together in the biggest screen you can find.

Talk about managing expectations ;).

Me and my son loving it! The best entertaining and exciting show of the year!,"This is my first IMDb review.

I've watched all 8 episodes in one day together with my 11 years old son and we truly enjoyed from the beginning til the end. We want 2nd season!!!

The series makes several references to the anime. We have in some moments the instrumental of the opening song of the anime. The story is engaging and good, and it's good to watch with your family members. Highly recommended.

Overall, its a good adaptation! I was shocked to find myself smiling whenever Godoy's Luffy comes on screen first episode and onward. The casting director did a fantastic job on finding actors to fit the characters as well as, the rest of the supporting cast! The subtle details they've added were a lovely touch to show they truly did their research. Even with the new changes they did, still feels like one piece at the end just in a different format. I didn't put it a full 10 star because there is always room for improvement!

A very good adaptation to the famous anime,"An absolute gem! This show is a must-watch, and I wholeheartedly recommend it. It easily outshines the mediocre anime adaptation that often fail to do justice to the source material. It's the second-best way to immerse yourself in the captivating world of One Piece, right after the original manga. The series flawlessly captures the essence of Eiichiro Oda's masterpiece, delivering a phenomenal experience. With its exceptional storytelling, rich character development, and meticulous attention to detail, it caters to both newcomers and die-hard fans alike. Whether you're new to the Grand Line or a seasoned pirate aficionado, this show is a treasure trove of entertainment that should not be missed. Now, some might complain about the changes they made such as introducing characters early into the series that normally wouldn't come until future arcs and a few others, but I say those people are f#%king nerds and who gives a sh#$.

This wonderful thing...,"I recently dived (no pun intended) into the world of One Piece anime and manga which I had avoided for years due to its length. However, once I gave it a chance, I found myself falling in love with Eiichiro Oda's characters, plot, themes, and the expansive world he created. When I first heard about the live-action adaptation, I was skeptical and expected it to be a failure. Despite my doubts, my heart hoped for its success, even though adapting such a complex source material seemed nearly impossible. One Piece, compared to other popular anime, is not an obvious choice for a successful live-action adaptation.

To my pleasant surprise, I couldn't have been more wrong. This live-action version took a unique approach, yet it managed to capture the essence and heart of the original material. It evoked the feelings of hope, passion, and genuine friendship that we all cherish. The emotional impact and plot twists were delivered effectively, and the character backstories added depth to each member of the cast. The actors, especially the Straw Hat crew, displayed excellent chemistry and did justice to their respective characters. The villains, with Buggy being a standout, were exemplary in their portrayals.

Some might argue that the emotional impact was less than that of the anime, possibly because the anime delivered these moments first, somewhat diminishing their impact in the live-action adaptation. Additionally, there were those who disliked the idea of a live-action adaptation from the beginning, making it challenging for them to appreciate it. It can be difficult to overcome such preconceived notions.

However, as a fan of both anime and TV series, I wholeheartedly recommend the One Piece live-action adaptation. You can truly sense the the heart of the entire team, from the production crew to the cast, in bringing this project to life. After a long, exhausting week at the start of the school year, I am grateful to have a series like this to provide a much-needed mental break and relief from exhaustion. Thank you, Oda, for creating this wonderful thing and for giving me even more reasons to fall deeper in love with your work.

PS: Emily Rudd , you are so beautiful as Nami! I am simping for you the whole time! HAHA

Now watch it!

Best adaptation so far,"I watched first eposide and I can say they did best they can. Although there are some changes and I think those are due to limitation of adapting diversed story of ONE PIECE.
