07-09-2023,im one suppose nonjapanese followed show beginning least first english fansubs hit net early st century think manga started animation couple years later damn thats nearly years ago first didnt think much style animation grown left college returned quickly got hooked following animation well late stopped watching years ago shortly time skip following whitebeard war since read manga though got rid merchandise still remember show fondly despite middle aged remains one exciting adventures character building modern science fiction fantasy mythologies oda something special story unique assimilation bewildering number historical pop culture references least hundreds characters largely caricatures famous japanese hollywood pop culture celebrities musicians englishman particularly drawn representation maritime history maritime nation british played large part good andor ill funnily enough little actual sailing maritime lore story clear oda little sailing experience chooses focus characters ludicrous scenarios doesnt make less interesting confuses slightly real even reference navigation ship mechanics takes place water transferred live action show though least moments navigation references port starboard least reason ended imdb today one piece headed netflix dont really use anymore watched first episodes bit low key seemed rushed clear wasnt huge budget one time sanji turned fully board clear though arent many special effects animation would prohibitively expensive probably overwhelming also clear lot love gone production casting spot remember reading years ago nationalities straw hat crew defined oda beginning hard tell original look japanese andor european realistically europeans generally variation hair eye colour glad see theyd course stuck odas specifications nationality great fact see represented first time course original speak japanese though speaking english actors english american luffy clearly brazilian though unclear course impossible gramps would scottish scots roots welcome addition maybe oda intended well clear show deviated manga storyline considerably brevitys sake story progression actually improvement ways terms nanis story particularly though must admit would liked krieg least moment missed jango hilarious kuro formidable seen making escape maybe hell return cant remember thought defeated completely original thing really hit merry getting killed course survived original story richie whole story mayors dog real tear jerker would time consuming buggy clown formidable original course ridiculous character even ridiculous henchmen actually pretty unnerving mildly terrifying adaptation suppose unsurprisingly somehow closer dc villain joker times intensity least beginning later hes disembodied head runs becomes closer original course fans manga know appears multiple times especially impel story ark always offering comic relief sometimes almost ally usually reverting back devious two faced cowardlyself serving ways great character look forward fleshing real criticism zoro meant japanese didnt get japanese kid american actor understand page several anime adaptations also flashback didnt look like japan japanese actors americans american karate kid style approximation supposed japanese dojo would expected modern day production shame couldnt insert based japanese story would nice kind nod flavour original japanese character authentic jjapanese back story feels much stronger fleshed original delivered would stars way never mind actor played zoro great job understand might jarring japanese zoro character background contrast parts story guess well never know incidentally indonesian action film youtube channel made amazing live action version zoro episode animation closer original netllfix one well worth tracking despite everything important thing emotional beats hit home like original found despite knowing story teared nami said help felt slightly rushed casting perfect story actually improved many places cant help love hope goes way whitebeard war beyond maybe even live action movies certainly probably best anime adaptation ever made standalone better mediocre stuff jams bloated streaming services days mean know human population grown exponentially along volume everything create ridiculous nowadays amount mediocre junk created long needed breath sea air hopefully represents sea change long may continue get funding needs know sadly maybe going years long like original even though oda stated years two three years passed story actors want things also would middle aged generally dont get axed netflix series rarely last longer seasons particularly niche weird fantasy elements cartoon characters well see fact would make sense show runs something like actual time original knows might make far franky water intense story arc lot filler imagine following least remake movies weve already introduction baroqueworks smoker crocodile princess vivi season maybe alabaster drum island introduction choppa season maybe fast forward franky robin season though would interesting see sky island weird certainly hope get probably favourite section thriller bark hilarious comedy horror probably funnier suited cartoon pretty freaky probably children live action damn show fun back least looks like get even better season,Positive
